## ü´ñRead About 

### 1Ô∏è‚É£What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that helps developers easily create, deploy, and run applications in containers. <br>
Containers are lightweight, portable environments that package everything needed to run a piece of software‚Äîcode, <br>
libraries, dependencies, and configuration‚Äîso it can run reliably on any system, regardless of the environment. <br><br>

**Key Concepts in Docker:**
1) **Containers:** <br>
- A container is like a small, lightweight virtual machine that runs an application and its dependencies on any system.<br>
- It ensures that the application works the same in different environments *(your laptop, the cloud, or on a server)*.<br>
- Unlike full virtual machines, containers share the host system‚Äôs OS kernel, <br>
 making them faster and more efficient in terms of resource usage.
2) **Images:** <br>
- A Docker image is like a template or blueprint for creating containers. <br>
 It contains everything needed to run an app, including the code, libraries, environment variables, and system tools.<br>
- Images are read-only, and when a container starts from an image, <br>
 it adds a writable layer on top of the image where it can make changes.<br>
3) **Docker Daemon:** <br>
- The Docker daemon is the background service that runs on your host machine and is responsible <br>
 for managing Docker containers, images, volumes, an networks.
- It listens for Docker commands and executes them *(like pulling images, starting containers, or creating networks)*.<br>
4) **Dockerfile:** <br>
- A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image.<br>
- Think of it as a recipe: it specifies the base image *(Debian)*, the app‚Äôs code, dependencies, and how to run the app.<br>
5) **Docker Hub:** <br>
- Docker Hub is like GitHub for Docker images. It‚Äôs a public registry where you can find and share Docker images.<br>
- You can pull official images *(like nginx, mysql, or python)* or push your own custom images to Docker Hub.<br>

<br>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£What is Docker-Compose?
Docker Compose is a tool used to easily manage and run multi-container applications.  <br>
Using a docker-compose.yml file, you can define and start all parts of your app *(web server, database, cache)* <br>
with a single command. *(Basiclly like a Makefile for docker)* <br>

<br>


---


### 3Ô∏è‚É£What are Multi-container Applications?
A multi-container application is an app that needs more than one Docker container to work.
- For example, let's say you have an e-commerce website. It might need:
    - A web server *(like Nginx or Apache)* to serve the website.
    - A database *(like MySQL or MongoDB)* to store user data.
    - A caching service *(like Redis)* to make things faster. <br>

Each of these components runs in its own container, but they work together to make the entire app function. <br>
This setup is called a multi-container application. <br> 

<br>


---


### 4Ô∏è‚É£What is a Docker Image?
A Docker image is like a blueprint or template for creating a Docker container.
- It contains everything needed to run an application, such as the code, libraries, and dependencies.
- When you start a container, it's created from a Docker image. <br>
 The image is read-only and acts as a recipe for how the container should be built. <br>

Think of a Docker image like a snapshot of your app environment that can be used <br>
to create multiple identical containers whenever you need. <br>

<br>

---


### 5Ô∏è‚É£What Are Volumes?
Docker containers are designed to be ephemeral *(short-lived)*, meaning that any data generated within <br>
the container during runtime will be lost once the container is stopped or removed. <br>
Volumes are used to persist important data outside of the container, <br>
allowing  you to keep that data even after the container is deleted or ontainer reboots <br>

**How volumes work:**
- Volumes are stored on the host machine outside the container‚Äôs filesystem, usually in */var/lib/docker/volumes/*.
- They allow data sharing between the host system and one or more containers.
- Volumes are independent of the container lifecycle, so data is safe even when the container is deleted or stopped. <br>

**Example Use Case:** <br>
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre running a database container like MySQL. <br>
You don‚Äôt want to lose your data every time the container stops. <br>
By using a volume, you can store the database data on your host machine, <br>
so that if you recreate the container, your data will still be there. <br>

**Example** how Volumes Are Defined in `docker-compose.yml`: <br>
```yaml
services:
    mariadb:
        [...]
        volumes: 
            - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    wordpress:
        [...]
    nginx:
        [...]

volumes:                                      
      mariadb:
            [...]                                             
                device: ${HOME}/data/db_data 

[...]
```

This means the database data is stored outside the container, <br>
and will be preserved even if the container is destroyed. 

<br>

### 6Ô∏è‚É£Virtual Machine vs Docker

**Summary of Differences:**

| Feature          | Virtual Machine (VM)                           | Docker (Container)                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Architecture**  | Full guest OS on top of host OS                | Shares host OS kernel, isolated by processes      |
| **Startup Speed** | Slow (minutes)                                 | Fast (seconds)                                   |
| **Resource Usage**| Heavy, each VM needs its own OS                | Lightweight, shares host OS                      |
| **Isolation**     | Full OS isolation (secure, but heavier)        | Process-level isolation, lighter but less isolated|
| **Portability**   | Less portable, larger images (full OS)         | Highly portable, smaller images                  |
| **Performance**   | Slower (due to full OS overhead)               | Faster (less overhead)                           |
| **Use Cases**     | Running multiple OSes, legacy apps, full OS isolation | Microservices, cloud apps, lightweight tasks  |
| **Size of Images**| Large (GBs)                                    | Small (MBs to GBs)                               |

<br>

**In Summary:**
- `Docker (containers)` is more lightweight, faster, and more efficient when running multiple applications on the same machine. <br>
 It's great for modern app development, where speed, portability, and scalability are key.
- `Virtual machines (VM)` offer more complete isolation and are better suited when you need to <br>
 run different operating systems or when full OS separation is required.

  <br>


## 2Ô∏è‚É£Create a Shared Folder

This is for the Oracle VirtualBox.
Set up shared folders in VirtualBox to easily transfer files between the host and guest. <br> <br> 

- Go to VM `Settings` -> `Shared Folders`
- Click the `+` icon to add a new shared folder
- ***Folder Path:*** The path to the shared folder on you host *(Create before this step a folder on your host)*
- ***Folder Name:*** Name of the folder you created on the host *(Fill in should happen automatically)*
- ***Mount Point:*** `/mnt/shared`
- Set `Auto-mount` option 
- `OK`
- Start your VM
- Go to `Devices` -> `Insert Guest Additions CD image...`
- **'cd..'** till you find the `mnt` folder
- ```bash
  sudo mount -t vboxsf <foldername> /mnt/shared
  ```
   Replace `<foldername>` with the name you set for the shared folder.
- **'cd'** into `/mnt/shared` *(You will find all your folders in there)*
<br> <br>

  <summary><strong>3Ô∏è‚É£Connect to your host terminal</strong></summary>
  <br>


## 3Ô∏è‚É£Connect to your host terminal

Connecting to your VM through the terminal simplifies your workflow. <br>
It allows for easy copy-pasting, regular terminal is faster then VM-terminal, <br>
and feels just like working locally with VS Code and your regular terminal, <br>
NO NEED to switch between multiple tools.

### First: 
- Go to VM `Settings` **->** `Network` **->** `Advanced` **->** `Port Forwarding`<br>
- Click the `+` icon to add a new port <br>
***Host IP:*** 127.0.0.1 <br>
***Host Port:*** 2222 *(could be any port number)* <br>
***Guest Port:*** 22 *(default SSH port on the guest)* <br>

### Second:
In VM terminal: <br>
*(only for the first time connecting to the VM)*
```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

### Third:
*(This command everytime you connect to the VM)*
```bash
ssh -p <port> <username>@127.0.0.1
```

### TEST:

``` bash
cd Desktop
touch IamHERE
```
&emsp;&emsp; **-> file should appear on your VM desktop** <br>

```bash
exit
```
&emsp;&emsp; **-> if you want to stop the connection**

## ü´ñSet Up

### üçøExtra

<details>
  <summary><strong>.env</strong></summary>
  <br>

## üß©.env:

The .env file allows you to keep configuration data separate from your codebase, <br>
making the application more flexible and easier to maintain. <br>
Instead of hardcoding values in your application, you can reference environment variables, <br>
which can be changed without altering the code. <br>
The variables in a .env often include sensitive or configuration-specific data, <br>
such as API keys, database credentials, or application settings. <br>
Sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and secrets should not be stored in your source code, <br>
so you store them in your .env to keep those secure. <br>

**For this projcet you can store:**
- Database connection details *(hostname, database name, credentials)*
- WordPress admin credentials (*for managing the site)*
- A regular user account *(for testing the site as a normal user)*

Ensure your .env file is in the same directory where you run the docker-compose command.<br>
Docker Compose looks for the .env file in the project directory by default.<br>

**Your .env file should look like this:** *(can ofcourese add more variables)*
```plaintext
# GENERAL
DOMAIN_NAME=[...]          # Intra user name

# DATABASES
WP_DATABASE_NAME=[...]     # Name of database that WordPress will use to store its data, which is wordpress
WP_DATABASE_HOST=[...]     # Name of the host database server for wordpress database, which is mariadb -> This is the service name used by Docker.

# MARIADB DATABASE
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=[...]     # Root password your choice 
DB_USER=[...]              # User your choice
DB_USER_PASSWORD=[...]     # Password your choice  

# WORDPRESS ADMIN
WP_ADMIN=[...]             # Admin your choice
WP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=[...]    # Admin password your choice 
WP_ADMIN_EMAIL=[...]       # Admin email your choice

# WORDPRESS USER
WP_USER=[...]              # User your choice
WP_USER_PASSWORD=[...]     # Password your choice 
WP_USER_EMAIL=[...]        # Email your choice
```

  <summary><strong>Dockerfile</strong></summary>
  <br>


## üß©Dockerfile:

The Dockerfile is used to define the environment and dependencies required for your application.

### Dockerfile Directives
**1. FROM** <br>
- `Purpose:`  <br>
Specifies the base image for the container. <br>
The base image acts as the foundation of your container and may already include essential software or libraries. <br>
- `Importance:` <br>
This is a mandatory directive and must appear as the first line in any Dockerfile.<br>
- `Details:` <br>
    - It defines the starting point for your container‚Äôs filesystem. <br>
    - Choosing the right base image can significantly reduce build time and simplify your Dockerfile. <br>
    **For example**, using a lightweight image like alpine can save space, whereas more feature-rich images like debian or ubuntu are better for compatibility. <br>

**2. WORKDIR** <br>
- `Purpose:` <br>
Sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow. <br>
- `Importance:` <br>
Optional, but useful when your application relies on relative paths or if you want a predictable directory structure within the container.<br>
- `Details:` <br>
    - Without WORKDIR, commands must use absolute paths, which can make your Dockerfile harder to read and maintain. <br>
    - If WORKDIR is not explicitly set, the default working directory is / *(the root directory)*. <br>

**3. ENV** <br>
- `Purpose:` <br>
Defines environment variables inside the container. <br>
These variables can configure the application, store secrets, or control runtime behavior.<br>
- `Importance:` <br>
Optional, but highly recommended for flexibility and reusability.<br>
- `Details:`<br>
    - Environment variables can be overridden at runtime using the docker run --env or --env-file options.<br>

**4. COPY** <br>
- `Purpose:` <br>
Copies files and directories from the build context on your host machine into the container‚Äôs filesystem.<br>
- `Importance:` <br>
Essential if your application or script requires external files *(source code, configuration files)*.<br>
- `Details:`<br>
    - Use COPY for simple, static file transfers.<br>
    - For more complex operations like downloading files or extracting archives, <br>
     use ADD *(though ADD is less commonly recommended due to its broader functionality and potential for unintended side effects)*.<br>

**5. EXPOSE** <br>
- `Purpose:` <br>
Documents the port(s) the container listens on at runtime.<br>
- `Importance:` <br>
Optional and informational only‚Äîit does not actually expose the port on the host.<br>
- `Details:`<br>
    - While optional, using EXPOSE helps other developers or tools understand which ports the container is designed to use.<br>
    
**6. ENTRYPOINT** <br>
- `Purpose:` <br>
Specifies the main process that will run when the container starts. <br>
It is used to make the container behave like a standalone executable.<br>
- `Importance:` <br>
Optional, but powerful for containers intended to run a single, dedicated task.<br>
- `Details:`<br>
    - ENTRYPOINT is designed to run as the container‚Äôs primary process and cannot be easily overridden with additional commands at runtime.<br>
    - It pairs well with CMD, which provides default arguments to the ENTRYPOINT.<br>
    
**7. CMD** <br>
- `Purpose:` <br>
Provides default instructions or arguments to be passed to the container‚Äôs main process.<br>
- `Importance:` <br>
Optional, but a best practice if you want your container to perform a default action.<br>
- `Details:`<br>
    - If both ENTRYPOINT and CMD are specified, CMD provides arguments to the ENTRYPOINT.<br>
    - If only CMD is used, it serves as the main command to execute.<br>
    - When no ENTRYPOINT is specified, CMD will directly run the provided command, making it sufficient for many simple containers.<br>
    - **For example**, you could specify CMD ["/bin/bash", "script.sh"] instead of setting up ENTRYPOINT<br>

<br>

**Example of a simple Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
# Use the official MariaDB image as the base image
FROM mariadb:10.6

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d

# Environment variables to configure MariaDB
# MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD is required for MariaDB to initialize
ENV MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecurepassword \
    MYSQL_DATABASE=myappdb \
    MYSQL_USER=myappuser \
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=appsecurepassword

# Copy custom initialization scripts into the container
# These scripts are executed when the container is started
COPY ./init-scripts/ /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/

# Expose the default MariaDB port
EXPOSE 3306

# Add an ENTRYPOINT to ensure the official MariaDB entrypoint is used
ENTRYPOINT ["docker-entrypoint.sh"]

# The CMD specifies the default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT
CMD ["mysqld"]
```

‚ùó**NOTE:** <br>
`In Dockerfile:` <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The RUN apt-get install command inside the Dockerfile runs as the root user by default, <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; which is why it works without any additional permissions. <br>
`In a Running Container:` <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When you're trying to manually install something by running apt-get <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; in an already running container, you must ensure you're using the root user. 

<br> <br>

  <summary><strong>Docker-compose.yml</strong></summary>
  <br>

## üß©Docker-compose.yml:


**#Ô∏è‚É£1. General Overview** <br>
This Docker Compose file defines a multi-container application that consists of three main services:
- MariaDB: The database service.
- Nginx: The web server that will serve the website.
- WordPress: The WordPress application itself. 
<br>

The volumes and networks help manage data persistence and network communication between these services. <br><br>

**#Ô∏è‚É£2. Version** <br>
The version key specifies the version of the Compose file format you're using.  <br>
But the newer Docker update doesn't require a version anymore, it will give you a warning. <br><br>

**#Ô∏è‚É£3. Services** <br>
The services key defines all the individual services *(containers)* that make up your application <br>
that will work together to create a multi-container environment.  <br>
Each service runs in its own container and represents a specific part of your application. <br>
Under services, you define three services:` mariadb`,` nginx`, and `wordpress`. <br>
Each one represents a different container that is built and managed by Docker Compose. <br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;***Breakdown of services*** <br>
&emsp;&emsp;`mariadb:` <br>
&emsp;&emsp;This service defines a MariaDB container *(the database)*. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;It will be used to store and serve data for your WordPress application. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;`nginx:` <br>
&emsp;&emsp;This service defines an Nginx container *(the web server)*. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Nginx acts as a reverse proxy that handles web traffic and directs it to the WP service. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;`wordpress:` <br>
&emsp;&emsp;This service defines a WordPress container *(the application)*. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;It will run the actual WordPress site, and it depends on the MariaDB for data storage. <br> <br>

**#Ô∏è‚É£4. Services Section** <br>
For each component, you define a service. <br>
A service represents a container and its associated configuration.<br>

&emsp;`Image:` What Docker image will be used *(e.g., mariadb, wordpress, or nginx)*? <br>
&emsp;`Build:` If you need a custom image, you specify a build section that <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;tells Docker Compose where to find the Dockerfile. <br>
&emsp;`Environment Variables:` What configuration does the container need at runtime? <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For instance, databases need credentials. <br>
&emsp;`Volumes:` Do you need to store data persistently or <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;share files between the container and the host? *(what ports to expose)* <br>
&emsp;`Ports:` Which ports need to be mapped between the host and the container? <br>
&emsp;`Network:` Do the containers need to communicate which each other? <br><br>

**#Ô∏è‚É£5. Environment Variables** <br>
Environment variables are commonly defined in a .env file for ease of management and security. <br><br>
**When using a .env file, you can reference it in your docker-compose.yml as:** <br>
```yml
env_file:
    - .env
```

But lets say yo don't have a .env file or you have variables that are executed after runtime. <br>
**You add the to your server like this:** <br>
```yml
environment:
      DOMAIN_NAME: ${DOMAIN_NAME}
      DB_USER: ${DB_USER}
      DB_USER_PASSWORD: ${DB_USER_PASSWORD}
```
**OR**
```yml
environment:
      DOMAIN_NAME: John_example
      DB_USER: John
      DB_USER_PASSWORD: john123
```
<br>

**Difference Between `args` and `environment`:**

1. ***args (Build Arguments):*** <br>
- Build-time variables used exclusively during the image build process *(via docker build or docker-compose build)*.
- Defined in the build section of docker-compose.yml and accessed using ARG in a Dockerfile.
- Once the image is built, these values are no longer accessible. <br><br>

2. ***environment:*** <br>
- Runtime variables available to the container during execution.
- These can be defined in docker-compose.yml, and accessed using ENV in a Dockerfile.
- Accessible to the application within the container via environment variable methods. <br>

In summary, args are temporary and limited to the image build process, <br>
while environment variables are persistent during the container's runtime and directly influence the application's behavior. <br><br>
**Example:**
```plaintext
                     -------- ARG --------

       Docker-Compose.yml:     |            Dockerfile:                  
    -----------------------------------------------------------
mariadb:                       |    FROM debian:buster
  build:                       |        
    context: src/mariadb       |    EXPOSE 9000 
    args:                      |    
      DB_USER: ${DB_USER}      |    ARG DB_USER
      [...]                    |    ARG [...]
                               |


                     -------- ENV --------

       Docker-Compose.yml:     |            Dockerfile:
    -----------------------------------------------------------
mariadb:                       |    FROM debian:buster
  build:                       |        
  context: src/mariadb         |    EXPOSE 9000 
  environment:                 |    
    DB_USER: ${DB_USER}        |    ENV DB_USER
    [...]                      |    ENV [...]
                               |  
```
<br>

**#Ô∏è‚É£6. Volumes** <br>
Volumes ensure that critical data *(like the MariaDB database and WordPress content)* persists across container restarts.
- MariaDB Volume *(mariadb:/var/lib/mysql)*: <br>
  - Reason: MariaDB stores the actual database files in /var/lib/mysql within the container. <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;By binding this to a host directory, you ensure that your databases <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;are persistent across container restarts. <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Without this, any database data would be lost when the container stops.<br>
- WordPress Volume *(wordpress:/var/www/html)*: <br>
  - Reason: WordPress stores files such as themes, plugins, and uploads in /var/www/html.<br> 
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;By binding this directory to the host, <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;your WordPress website's content persists even when <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the container is restarted or removed.<br>
- Nginx Volume *(nginx:/var/www/html)*: (NOT NECESSARY) <br>
  - Optional Use Case: If you need to store static files, custom configurations, or logs, you can bind mount a directory for Nginx. <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Since you're using WordPress and Nginx is just serving it, <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;this may not be necessary unless you're doing something <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;like custom Nginx configurations.<br><br>

**#Ô∏è‚É£7. Networks**<br>
Networks allow your containers to communicate with each other <br>
internally on a dedicated Docker network.<br> <br>
**All three containers should have:**
```yaml
services:
  mariadb:
    [...]
    networks:
      - inception        # Connect MariaDB to the "inception" network

  nginx:
    [...]
    networks:
      - inception        # Connect Nginx to the "inception" network

  wordpress:
    [...]
    networks:
      - inception        # Connect WordPress to the "inception" network

networks:                # Network configuration
      inception:
        [...]
```

This setup provides a robust architecture for running a WordPress site backed by MariaDB with Nginx acting as a reverse proxy, <br>
ensuring data persistence and internal communication. <br>

***Why do you need a custom network?*** <br>
- `Internal Communication:` <br>
  - All services in your Compose file *(mariadb, nginx, and wordpress)* <br>
    are connected to the inception network.  <br>
  - This allows the services to communicate internally using container names as hostnames. <br>
- `Easy Service Discovery:` <br>
  - Docker automatically provides service discovery on custom networks.  <br>
  - **For example**, in your WordPress container, if you set DB_HOSTNAME: mariadb, Docker will <br>
    know to resolve mariadb to the correct container's IP address because both services <br>
    are on the same inception network. <br>

 <!-- 
# MariaDB

WordPress relies on a database to store its data. <br>
The MariaDB container provides this, so it needs to be up and running first.<br>
This ensures WordPress can connect to the database as soon as it starts.<br> <br>

To set up a MariaDB container with custom configuration, you would typically need: <br>
- **Dockerfile** : <br>
This defines the MariaDB image build, installing any necessary tools and copying configuration files into the container. <br>
- **Initialization Script (db-script.sh)** : <br>
This script initializes the database, sets up users, databases, and permissions, <br>
and ensures that MariaDB keeps running in the foreground. <br>
- **Custom Configuration File (db-config.cnf)** : <br>
This file customizes MariaDB‚Äôs server settings, like port, bind address, caching, logging, and character sets. <br> <br>


###  .conf and .cnf
difference between `.conf` and `.cnf`

Both `.conf` and `.cnf` are commonly used for configuration files, but they are often associated with different types of applications or services.
Key Differences: 
`.conf` is more general and used by many different types of software, associated with operating system services and various servers.
`.cnf` is more specialized, often used for MySQL and database-related configurations, associated with database configurations.

### Script 
Such a script usually takes care of preparing the environment, initializing the database if necessary, setting up security configurations, creating a database, and ensuring MariaDB runs in the foreground.

MariaDB initialization script step by step:
This is the "shebang" line. It tells the system that the script should be executed using /bin/bash, a common Unix shell.
You alway need this line at the top of your script.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
- Create, Move, Set Permissions for necessary Directories (If needed):
MariaDB requires specific directories for data and logs. The script should create these directories and adjust permissions to ensure that the MariaDB process has access to them.
- This Step can be different for everyone:
- Option 1):
Check if the Database Directory Exists:
The script checks if the MariaDB data directory is already initialized. If not, it initializes the database.
      - MariaDB Installation:
        This script segment automates the security questions asked during the mysql_secure_installation. Options include:
            - Setting a root password
            - Removing anonymous users
            - Reloading privilege tables
      - Create a New Database (if specified):
        If you want to create a new database, you can add a check and run the necessary SQL command.
      - Create a New User and Grant Privileges (if specified):
        If a user and password are provided, the script creates the user and grants the necessary privileges.
            - CREATE USER: Adds a new user with a specified password.
            - GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES: Gives the new user full access to the specified database.
            - FLUSH PRIVILEGES: Refreshes the privilege tables to apply changes.
- Option 2):
Skip ro reloading privilege tables
If a user and password are provided, the script creates the user and grants the necessary privileges.
            - CREATE DATABASE: Adds a database with specified name.
            - CREATE USER: Adds a new user with a specified password.
            - GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES: Gives the new user full access to the specified database.
            - FLUSH PRIVILEGES: Refreshes the privilege tables to apply changes.
            - Use --bootstrap option
- Keep MariaDB Running in the Foreground:
To ensure the database service stays active in the foreground (important for containerized environments like Docker).
            - `exec mysqld` replaces the current shell process with the MariaDB server, keeping it running in the foreground.


--bootstrap
What Does --bootstrap Do?
The --bootstrap option is a special mode for MariaDB's server process (mysqld) that:

Starts the server without networking or any background services.
Allows initialization scripts to run within a safe, minimal environment.
Automatically exits after processing the commands.
It is typically used for initial setup tasks like:

Setting up system databases (mysql, information_schema, etc.).
Creating or configuring initial users and permissions.
Avoiding unnecessary overhead or conflicts during first-time setup.

Why Use --bootstrap?
Efficiency: The server is started in a lightweight mode without overhead from networking, plugins, or other features unnecessary during initialization.
Isolation: No external connections or conflicts occur during setup.
Automation: It‚Äôs a safe way to run one-time initialization scripts programmatically without starting the full server.


### Config.cnf

The db_config.cnf file is a configuration file for the MariaDB server, specifically for setting server-side options that control database behavior, storage, networking, and performance. 
You can find an example of an config.cnf on [ibm](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ztpf/2023?topic=performance-mariadb-configuration-file-example) or [github](https://gist.github.com/fevangelou/fb72f36bbe333e059b66).


Detail Explaination of config.cnf variable options:

# Structure of the Configuration File
1) Sections:
Configuration files are organized into sections. Each section starts with a name in square brackets, such as [server], [mysqld], [embedded], etc. The parameters defined under each section apply to that specific component of MariaDB.
2) Key-Value Pairs:
Each setting is defined as a key-value pair, where the key is the configuration option, and the value specifies its setting.

# 1) Sections: General Server Configuration Sections
The configuration file is divided into sections (like [mysqld], [mariadb], etc.) that specify settings for different components of the MariaDB server. Each section can contain specific settings related to that component.
- `[server]` : This section applies to the entire MariaDB server, both for standalone and embedded servers.
- `[mysqld]` : Settings in this section apply only to the mysqld standalone MariaDB server daemon.
- `[embedded]`, `[mariadb]`, `[mariadb-10.3]` : These sections define options specific to embedded servers, MariaDB-specific options, and MariaDB version-specific settings, respectively.

# 2) Key-Value Pairs: Basic Settings
# User and PID file settings
- `user` : Sets the user under which the MariaDB server runs.
- `pid-file` : Path for the PID file, which helps manage the MariaDB process.

# Socket and Port settings
- `socket` : Location of the MariaDB Unix socket file for local connections.
- `port` : Sets the port for TCP/IP connections (default MySQL/MariaDB port).

# Directories settings
- `basedir` : Base directory where MariaDB is installed.
- `datadir` : Directory for storing database files.
- `tmpdir` : Temporary files directory used by the server.
- `lc-messages-dir` : Directory for error messages and translations.

# Network settings
- `bind-address` : Specifies the network interface on which MariaDB listens for incoming connections. Setting this to 0.0.0.0 means it accepts connections from all interfaces.

# Fine Tuning
This section contains various parameters that can fine-tune the performance of the server.
Example parameters:
- `key_buffer_size        = 16M`
- `max_allowed_packet     = 16M`
- `thread_stack           = 192K`
- `thread_cache_size      = 8`
- `myisam_recover_options = BACKUP`
- `max_connections        = 100`
- `table_cache            = 64`
- `thread_concurrency     = 10`

# Query Cache Configuration
- `query_cache_size` : Size of the query cache, which stores results of queries to improve performance.

# Logging and Replication
- `log_error` : Path to the error log file, which is crucial for troubleshooting.
- `expire_logs_days` : Number of days to keep binary logs before they are automatically removed.

# Settings for general logging and slow query logging if desired:
- `general_log_file       = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log`
- `general_log            = 1`
- `slow_query_log_file    = /var/log/mysql/mariadb-slow.log`
- `long_query_time        = 10`
- `log_slow_rate_limit    = 1000`
- `log_slow_verbosity     = query_plan`
- `log-queries-not-using-indexes`

# Replication setup
- `server-id              = 1`
- `log_bin                = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log`
- `max_binlog_size        = 100M`
- `binlog_do_db           = include_database_name`
- `binlog_ignore_db       = exclude_database_name`

# Security Features
Security configurations related to connections and SSL.
Uncomment and configure if required.
- `chroot = /var/lib/mysql/`
- `ssl-ca = /etc/mysql/cacert.pem`
- `ssl-cert = /etc/mysql/server-cert.pem`
- `ssl-key = /etc/mysql/server-key.pem`
- `ssl-cipher = TLSv1.2  # Ensure the latest TLS protocol is used for secure connections.`

# Character Sets
Character set settings to support various languages and symbols.
- `character-set-server` : Defines the default character set for the server.
- `collation-server` : Defines the default collation for string comparison.

# Unix Socket Authentication Plugin
This is for Unix socket authentication, allowing the root user to authenticate without a password when running as the Unix root user.
See https://mariadb.com/kb/en/unix_socket-authentication-plugin/ for details.

# this is only for embedded server
[embedded]

# This group is only read by MariaDB servers, not by MySQL.
# If you use the same .cnf file for MySQL and MariaDB,
# you can put MariaDB-only options here.
[mariadb]

# This group is only read by MariaDB-10.3 servers.
# If you use the same .cnf file for MariaDB of different versions,
# use this group for options that older servers don't understand.

# Specific settings for MariaDB server. This section can be used for MariaDB-specific configurations.

[mariadb-10.3]
# Settings specific to MariaDB version 10.3. This section allows version-specific configurations.
```


### Test MariaDB 
Navigate to the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` and run the following command:

RUN:
- Build your container
- View Logs: (fix them first)
```bash
docker-compose logs mariadb
```
- Accessing the MariaDB Instance:
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
-> If everything works till here your database is running 
- 1. Verify Database and User Creation:
```sql
# SHOW DATABASES;
```
-> Make sure your database (your_database_name) is listed. 
-> Should look like:
```sql
MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| wordpress          |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

- 2. Check if your user is created with the right permissions:
```sql
# SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
```
-> This should list your USER.
-> Should look like:
```sql
MariaDB [(none)]> SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
+------+-----------+
| User | Host      |
+------+-----------+
| bob  | %         |
| root | localhost |
+------+-----------+
2 rows in set (0.000 sec)
```

- 3. To confirm the user's permissions:
```sql
# SHOW GRANTS FOR '<USER>'@'%';
```
If the USER does not have the correct permissions:
-> Should look like:
```sql
MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'bob'@'%';
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for bob@%                                                                                   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `bob`@`%` IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '*61584B76F6ECE8FB9A328E7CF198094B2FAC55C7' |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
-> If your database, and user ist correct Everything works. And Mariadb is Running with the correct settings.
```

- Wordpress

 <!-- 
 # wordpress

Once MariaDB is up, start the WordPress container. 
During startup, WordPress will try to connect to the database, so having MariaDB ready beforehand is essential.
WordPress will connect to MariaDB using environment variables (like database host, username, and password) in your docker-compose.yml file or Docker run command.

NOTE: Make sure you have the newes stable version of PHP and Debian or Alphine.

Instead of using php-fpm7.4 OR php-fpm8.2 , simply use php-fpm (which will default to the latest installed version of PHP-FPM).

Important Considerations:

### Script

Make sure that your wp-script.sh does two critical things:
Install and Configure WordPress: Download WordPress, configure database credentials (through wp-config.php), 
and ensure that WordPress files are in the right place.
Start PHP-FPM: It should start the php-fpm process to handle incoming PHP requests. If php-fpm isn't started, the container will not be able to serve any requests.


Example of wp-script.sh:
This is the "shebang" line. It tells the system that the script should be executed using /bin/bash, a common Unix shell.
You alway need this line at the top of your script.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
- Create, Move, Set Permissions for necessary Directories (If needed):
WordPress requires specific directories for data and logs. The script should create these directories and adjust permissions to ensure that the WordPress process has access to them.
- This Step can be different for everyone:
- Check If You have a wp-config.php file / or if index.php exist
    - Install command wp (WP-CLI) -> You can also do this step in the wordpress dockerfile.
    - Connect to Database (mariadb) Use mysqladmin, NOT mysql
    - Only do this if you didn't create a wp-config.php manually
        - Don't recommand to create a wp-config manually
        - Different wp commands [Subcommands](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/config/)
        - Creating WordPress Configuration (wp config create) [Syntax](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/config/create/)
        - Create Wordpress Admin (wp core install) [Syntax](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/core/install/)
	    - Create Wordpress User (wp user create) [Syntax](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/user/create/)
- Keep WordPress Running in the Foreground:
To ensure the PHP-FPM service stays active in the foreground (important for containerized environments like Docker).
            - `/usr/sbin/php-fpm8.2 -F` keeping it running in the foreground.


### wp-config.php

I don't recommand doing a wp-config manually (for the Inception project)
You need to pass the .env variables, but that is a bit more difficult, because using getenv() is not working quite the way it should.
You could hardcode the variables, which defeds the purpos of the .env variables.
Creating WordPress Configuration with 'wp config create' fix the hardcoding problem. because it creates a wp-config.php for you.

But If you want to create a wp-config.php manually:

- 1. wp-config.php [example](https://www.vodien.com/help/article/how-to-create-wp-config-php-file)
- 2. Generating the Authentication Keys and Salts for wp-config.php
The values for AUTH_KEY, SECURE_AUTH_KEY, etc., are security keys and salts that WordPress uses for encrypting information stored in user cookies. You can generate new ones using the [WordPress Secret Key Generator](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/). Simply visit that URL, and it will provide a unique set of values. Copy and paste these into your wp-config.php file where you see the keys and salts defined.

        ------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------
                                            |Example www.conf File
Here‚Äôs an example of a minimal www.conf file suitable for a WordPress container:

ini
Copy
Edit
[www]
user = www-data
group = www-data

listen = 9000                           ; PHP-FPM listens on port 9000

pm = dynamic                            ; Process management style
pm.max_children = 10                    ; Max number of child processes
pm.start_servers = 3                    ; Start this many processes on startup
pm.min_spare_servers = 2                ; Minimum spare workers
pm.max_spare_servers = 5                ; Maximum spare workers

; Logging settings
access.log = /var/log/php-fpm/access.log
error_log = /var/log/php-fpm/error.log
log_level = notice

; Security and permissions
listen.owner = www-data
listen.group = www-data
listen.mode = 0660
How to Use www.conf in Your WordPress Dockerfile
Locate or Create the File:

Use the default file from PHP-FPM or create a custom one like the example above.
Include It in the Docker Image:

Your Dockerfile copies the file:
dockerfile
Copy
Edit
COPY /tools/www.conf /etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d/
This ensures your custom settings are applied when the container runs.
Ensure PHP-FPM Uses It:

PHP-FPM automatically loads configuration files from /etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d/. No further action is needed unless you override this behavior.
What Happens If You Don‚Äôt Use www.conf?
Default Configuration:

PHP-FPM will use its default www.conf, which might not match your container‚Äôs needs (e.g., port 9000, resource limits).
Incompatibility with Your Setup:

If the default www.conf doesn‚Äôt listen on port 9000, your WordPress container won‚Äôt work as intended, and connections from NGINX or other services will fail.
Suboptimal Performance:

Without fine-tuning, PHP-FPM might underperform or waste resources in your environment.

define( 'WP_DATABASE_NAME', 'wordpress' );  |       define( 'WP_DATABASE_NAME', getenv('$WP_DATABASE_NAME'));
define( 'DB_USER', 'user' );                |       define( 'DB_USER', getenv('$MYSQL_USER') ); 
define( 'DB_USER_PASSWORD', 'pwd' );        |       define( 'DB_USER_PASSWORD', getenv('$MYSQL_USER_PASSWORD') );
define( 'DB_HOST', 'mariadb' );             |       define( 'DB_HOST', getenv('$MYSQL_HOST') ); 
define( 'DB_CHARSET', 'utf8' );             |       define( 'DB_CHARSET', 'utf8' );
define( 'DB_COLLATE', '' );                 |       define( 'DB_COLLATE', '' );

```

### www.conf
Copy the www.conf file into your Docker image and customize it to suit your WordPress container‚Äôs requirements.
What Happens If You Don‚Äôt Use www.conf?

PHP-FPM will use its default www.conf, which might not match your container‚Äôs needs (e.g., port 9000, resource limits).
If the default www.conf doesn‚Äôt listen on port 9000, your WordPress container won‚Äôt work as intended, and connections from NGINX or other services will fail.
Without fine-tuning, PHP-FPM might underperform or waste resources in your environment.

How to Use www.conf in Your WordPress Dockerfile
- Locate or Create the File
- Copy to /etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d/ (overwrite)
This ensures your custom settings are applied when the container runs.



Example www.conf File
```ini
[www]
user = www-data
group = www-data

listen = 9000                           ; PHP-FPM listens on port 9000

pm = dynamic                            ; Process management style
pm.max_children = 10                    ; Max number of child processes
pm.start_servers = 3                    ; Start this many processes on startup
pm.min_spare_servers = 2                ; Minimum spare workers
pm.max_spare_servers = 5                ; Maximum spare workers

; Logging settings
access.log = /var/log/php-fpm/access.log
error_log = /var/log/php-fpm/error.log
log_level = notice

; Security and permissions
listen.owner = www-data
listen.group = www-data
listen.mode = 0660
```



### Test wordpress

To test if your WordPress setup is working in Docker, you need to ensure that the WordPress container is up and accessible. 
Make sure your wordpress container is running (docker ps) and that you don't have any errors in your docker logs.

go into the docker container
```bash
docker exec -it <wordpress_container_name> bash
```

Then navigate to the directory where WordPress is located (usually /var/www/html for Dockerized WordPress):
```bash
ls /var/www/html/wordpress
```
make sure all php files are listed.
Something like this:
```plaintext

-rw-r--r--  1 root     root      3246 Nov 24 17:17 xmlrpc.php
```

Confirm both wordpress and mariadb are connected to the same network.
How do I check that?
```bash
docker network inspect <network_name>
```

Check if the network name is correct.
Check that all containers are listed under the correct network name.
confirm the IPv4 Address are reachable on this network (172.18.0.x).
Something like that:
```plaintext
[...]
Network Name: inception_net
Containers Connected:
    wordpress:
        [...]
        IPv4 Address: 172.18.0.3
    mariadb:
        [...]
        IPv4 Address: 172.18.0.2
    nginx:
        [...]
        IPv4 Address: 172.18.0.4
[...]
```

Verify functionality by accessing WordPress in your browser:
```bash
https://<DOMAIN_NAME>
```

-->




















- Nginx

 <!-- 
# NGINX

Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and web server for WordPress.
It can only serve WordPress properly if the WordPress container is already up and running, so start Nginx last.


To set up a Nginx container with custom configuration, you would typically need: <br>
- **Dockerfile** : <br>
This defines the nginx image build, installing any necessary tools and copying configuration files into the container. <br>
- **Initialization Script (nginx-script.sh)** : NOT necessary (you could also do this in you dockerfile)<br>
- **Custom Configuration File (nginx-config.conf)** : <br>
<br> <br>

### Script
In your script you create a self-signed SSL certificate for TLS (But this step you could also do in the dockerfile)
openssl req [syntax](https://knowledge.digicert.com/general-information/openssl-quick-reference-guide)


script.sh:
```
#!/bin/bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out $CERTS_ -subj "/C=MO/L=KH/O=1337/OU=student/CN=sahafid.42.ma"
```
```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key \
    -out $CERTS_ \
    -subj "/C=MO/L=KH/O=1337/OU=student/CN=sahafid.42.ma"
```

Generates a self-signed SSL certificate for one year (-days 365).
Creates a private key (-keyout) and a certificate (-out).
-subj specifies the certificate details like country (C=MO), organization (O=1337), etc.
The $CERTS_ environment variable is used as the path to save the generated certificate.


These warnings are caused by missing values for several subject attributes in the openssl req command used to generate the SSL certificate.

C= stands for Country Name.
ST= stands for State or Province.
L= stands for Locality (City).
O= stands for Organization.
Since you haven‚Äôt specified these fields, OpenSSL is skipping them. The command still generates the certificate, but these attributes are left empty.

This is usually not an issue if you're creating a self-signed certificate for local or testing purposes (like in your case with nginx), but for production, it‚Äôs a good practice to fill out those values to avoid warnings or errors from browsers when using the certificate.


### Config.conf 

1. listen Directive for SSL
```nginx
listen 443 ssl;
listen [::]:443 ssl;
```
These lines look good and will bind both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to port 443 for SSL.

2. server_name Directive
```nginx
server_name $DOMAIN_NAME www.$DOMAIN_NAME localhost;
```
This line sets the server name for your virtual host. Ensure that $DOMAIN_NAME is set correctly in the environment, or replace it with an actual domain name (e.g., example.com). Otherwise, NGINX might fail to parse the variable.

3. SSL Settings
```nginx
ssl on;
ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
```
ssl on; is technically redundant and can be omitted. Including ssl in the listen directive (listen 443 ssl;) is sufficient to enable SSL.
Certificates: The paths are correct, assuming these files exist at the specified locations.
SSL Protocols: Specifying TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 is a good practice to support the most secure and compatible protocols. You may also want to add an ssl_ciphers directive to control which ciphers are allowed:
```nginx
ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
```

4. File Handling
```nginx
root /var/www/html;
index index.html index.php;
try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
```

These settings look fine:
root sets the document root for the server.
index specifies default files when a directory is requested.
try_files $uri $uri/ =404; tries to load the file directly or look for a directory with the requested name; if neither exists, it returns a 404 error.

5. PHP Location Block
```nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
    fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;
    fastcgi_index index.php;
    include fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
}
```
fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000; assumes that there‚Äôs a FastCGI server (e.g., PHP-FPM) available at wordpress:9000.
Make sure the hostname wordpress resolves within your Docker network or adjust this to 127.0.0.1:9000 if running PHP-FPM locally in the container.
SCRIPT_FILENAME and PATH_INFO parameters look good.
include fastcgi_params;: Ensure that fastcgi_params exists in your configuration files (usually in /etc/nginx/), as it includes essential FastCGI parameters.

Final Suggested Config File
Here‚Äôs the configuration with the improvements and comments integrated:
```nginx
server {
    listen                  443 ssl;
    listen                  [::]:443 ssl;
    server_name             $DOMAIN_NAME www.$DOMAIN_NAME localhost;

    # SSL
    ssl_certificate         /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key     /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
    ssl_protocols           TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers             HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # File Handling
    root                    /var/www/html;
    index                   index.html index.php;
    try_files               $uri $uri/ =404;

    # PHP Processing
    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass        wordpress:9000;  # Ensure the 'wordpress' hostname resolves correctly
        fastcgi_index       index.php;
        include             fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param       SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param       PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
    }
}
```

### Extra

to use your DOMAIN_NAME
https://<DOMAIN_NAME>.

You need to add it in /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 <DOMAIN_NAME>


Differenc between https and http?
The main difference between HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) lies in the security of the data transmitted between the user's browser and the server. Here's a detailed comparison:

1. Encryption:
HTTP: Does not encrypt the data being transmitted. This makes it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access by attackers.
HTTPS: Encrypts the data using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocols, ensuring secure communication.
2. Security:
HTTP: Susceptible to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and data tampering since the data is transmitted in plain text.
HTTPS: Protects against such attacks by encrypting the connection, making it ideal for sensitive information like login credentials, financial transactions, and personal data.
3. Authentication:
HTTP: Does not verify the identity of the server, leaving users vulnerable to phishing attacks.
HTTPS: Uses SSL/TLS certificates to authenticate the server, assuring users that they are communicating with the intended website.
4. Browser Indicators:
HTTP: Modern browsers often label HTTP websites as "Not Secure" in the address bar.
HTTPS: Websites using HTTPS display a padlock icon in the address bar, indicating a secure connection.
5. SEO and Trust:
HTTP: May result in lower search engine rankings as search engines prioritize secure websites.
HTTPS: Favored by search engines, contributing to better rankings. It also builds trust with users due to its security features.
6. Performance:
HTTP: Slightly faster because it doesn't involve the overhead of encrypting and decrypting data.
HTTPS: Slightly slower due to encryption overhead, but modern optimizations in hardware and software have minimized this impact.
7. Port Usage:
HTTP: Uses port 80 by default.
HTTPS: Uses port 443 by default.
Summary:
Use HTTP for non-sensitive, public information where security isn't a concern.
Use HTTPS for any scenario involving sensitive data, user authentication, or where trust and security are priorities. Most modern websites have adopted HTTPS due to its significant advantages.


### Test nginx

make sure you have no errors in your docker logs
make sure your pathways are the same/correct:

ssl_certificate         /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
ssl_certificate_key     /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;

Make sur /etc/nginx/ssl hav ethe right primmissions


Your docker logs might print something like this 
```objectivec
Create a self-signed SSL certificate...
.+...+.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*...........+...
```
This part is generated by the openssl req command, which is used to generate a self-signed SSL certificate. The characters you're seeing like +, *, and . represent the progress of the SSL certificate generation process, which is normal output for OpenSSL commands. These are just indicators of the internal progress, but they don't affect the result of the SSL certificate creation.
