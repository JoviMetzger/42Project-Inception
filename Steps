# Inception
Inception
This project is designed to broaden your understanding of system administration by using Docker.
You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual
machine.

### Step by step -------------------------------
1) Read about (make sure you understand):
    - What is Docker?
    - What is Docker Compose?
    - What are Multi-container Applications?
    - What is a Docker Image?
    - What Are Volumes?
    - How Daemons Work?
2) Set up your Virtual Machine
    - Either with [Ubuntu]() or [POP!_OS]()
3) Connect your Virtual Machine and VS code
    - Create a shared folder, between your VM and host.
    - Work over your host terminal, because VM terminal sucks.
4) You then have to set up:
    - MariaDB
    - Wordpress
    - Nginx
    - Start with `Docker-compose`, then MariaDB, wordpress and then NGINX.
    • A Docker container that contains MariaDB only without nginx.
    • A Docker container that contains WordPress + php-fpm (it must be installed and configured) only without nginx.
    • A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.
    • A volume that contains your WordPress database.
    • A second volume that contains your WordPress website files.
    • A docker-network that establishes the connection between your containers.

### --------------------------------------------
### Step 4 Explain -----------------------------

You need to start with MariaDB, as it is the database backend for WordPress. 
Here’s the ideal sequence and why:

MariaDB:
WordPress relies on a database to store its data. The MariaDB container provides this, so it needs to be up and running first.
This ensures WordPress can connect to the database as soon as it starts.

WordPress:
Once MariaDB is up, start the WordPress container. During startup, WordPress will try to connect to the database, so having MariaDB ready beforehand is essential.
WordPress will connect to MariaDB using environment variables (like database host, username, and password) in your docker-compose.yml file or Docker run command.

Nginx:
Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and web server for WordPress.
It can only serve WordPress properly if the WordPress container is already up and running, so start Nginx last.

### --------------------------------------------
### Docker -------------------------------------

1. What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that helps developers easily create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable environments that package everything needed to run a piece of software—code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration—so it can run reliably on any system, regardless of the environment.

Here’s a simple breakdown:
Key Concepts in Docker:
- 1) Containers:
    - A container is like a small, lightweight virtual machine that runs an application and its dependencies.
    - It ensures that the application works the same in different environments (e.g., on your laptop, in the cloud, or on a server).
    - Unlike full virtual machines, containers share the host system’s OS kernel, making them faster and more efficient in terms of resource usage.
- 2) Images:
    - A Docker image is like a template or blueprint for creating containers. It contains everything needed to run an app, including the code, libraries, environment variables, and system tools.
    - Images are read-only, and when a container starts from an image, it adds a writable layer on top of the image where it can make changes.
- 3) Docker Daemon:
    - The Docker daemon (dockerd) is the background service that runs on your host machine and is responsible for managing Docker containers, images, volumes, and networks.
    - It listens for Docker commands and executes them (like pulling images, starting containers, or creating networks).
- 4) Dockerfile:
    - A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions to create a Docker image.
    - Think of it as a recipe: it specifies the base image (e.g., python:3.9), the app’s code, dependencies, and how to run the app.

Example of a simple Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install the dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Command to run the app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
- 5) Docker Hub:
    - Docker Hub is like GitHub for Docker images. It’s a public registry where you can find and share Docker images.
    - You can pull official images (like nginx, mysql, or python) or push your own custom images to Docker Hub.

Why Use Docker?
- 1) Portability:
    - Docker ensures that your app will run the same way on different machines or environments. Once it's packed in a container, you can move that container across systems (from your laptop to production servers) without worrying about compatibility issues.
- 2) Consistency:
    - Since all dependencies and environment configurations are included inside the container, there are no "it works on my machine" problems anymore. Containers behave the same no matter where they run.
- 3) Lightweight:
    - Containers use less overhead compared to virtual machines because they share the host system's kernel, making them faster to start and requiring fewer resources.
- 4) Isolation:
    - Containers are isolated from one another and the host system. This isolation helps to avoid conflicts (e.g., two applications needing different versions of the same dependency).
- 5) Scalability:
    - Docker makes it easy to scale applications by running multiple instances of containers. This is especially useful in cloud environments where you can spin up containers as needed.


In Docker: The RUN apt-get install command inside the Dockerfile runs as the root user by default, which is why it works without any additional permissions.
In a Running Container: When you're trying to manually install something by running apt-get in an already running container, you must ensure you're using the root user. If you're inside a running container and need to run a command with apt-get, you can switch to the root user.

### Docker-Compose -----------------------------

2. What is Docker Compose?
Docker Compose is a tool used to easily manage and run multi-container Docker applications.
- Imagine you have a project with multiple parts, like a web app, a database, and maybe a message broker. Instead of running each part manually, Docker Compose lets you define all of them in a single file (called docker-compose.yml) and start everything with one command.
So, Docker Compose simplifies running complex applications with multiple containers.



### --------------------------------------------


---


### Multi-container------------------------------

3. What are Multi-container Applications?
A multi-container application is an app that needs more than one Docker container to work.
- For example, let's say you have an e-commerce website. It might need:
    - A web server (like Nginx or Apache) to serve the website.
    - A database (like MySQL or MongoDB) to store user data.
    - A caching service (like Redis) to make things faster.
Each of these components runs in its own container, but they work together to make the entire app function. This setup is called a multi-container application.

### --------------------------------------------


---


### Docker Image--------------------------------
4. What is a Docker Image?
A Docker image is like a blueprint or template for creating a Docker container.
- It contains everything needed to run an application, such as the code, libraries, and dependencies.
- When you start a container, it's created from a Docker image. The image is read-only and acts as a recipe for how the container should be built.
Think of a Docker image like a snapshot of your app environment that can be used to create multiple identical containers whenever you need.

### --------------------------------------------


---


### Volumes-------------------------------------

5. What Are Volumes?
Docker volumes are used to persist data generated or used by Docker containers. Normally, when a container is stopped or removed, all the data inside it is lost. Volumes allow you to keep that data even after the container is deleted.

Here’s how volumes work:
- Volumes are stored on the host machine outside the container’s filesystem, usually in /var/lib/docker/volumes/.
- They allow data sharing between the host system and one or more containers.
- Volumes are independent of the container lifecycle, so data is safe even when the container is deleted or stopped.

Example Use Case:
Let’s say you’re running a database container like PostgreSQL. You don’t want to lose your data every time the container stops. By using a volume, you can store the database data on your host machine, so that if you recreate the container, your data will still be there.

How Volumes Are Defined in `docker-compose.yml`:
In the `docker-compose.yml` example I gave earlier, this section:
```yaml
volumes:
  db_data:
```
Defines a named volume called db_data. It is used by the PostgreSQL service to store its data:
```yaml
volumes:
  - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```
This means the database data is stored outside the container, and will be preserved even if the container is destroyed.

### --------------------------------------------


---


### Daemons ------------------------------------

6. How Daemons Work?
A daemon is a background process that runs without user interaction. In Docker, the Docker daemon is the main program that manages containers, images, networks, and volumes. It listens for commands (like docker run or docker-compose up) and handles tasks like building, running, or stopping containers.

Here’s how Docker daemons work:
- `Docker Daemon (dockerd)` : The Docker daemon runs as a background process on the host machine. It listens to Docker API requests (commands you give Docker) and manages containers and resources (e.g., networks, volumes).
- `Client interaction` : The Docker client (CLI) is what you interact with when you run Docker commands. It communicates with the Docker daemon, which actually performs the tasks.
- `Container management` : The daemon handles everything related to containers, including creating, running, stopping, or destroying them.

Example:
When you run docker run to start a container, the Docker daemon:
- Pulls the required image if it’s not available locally.
- Creates a container from the image.
- Allocates resources (CPU, memory, storage) to the container.
- Runs the container in the background or attached to your terminal.

Should You Use Daemons?
The term daemon in Docker specifically refers to the background Docker process (the dockerd process), but in general computing, daemons refer to any background service or process. Let's look at when using daemons (background processes) is a good idea and when it might not be:

Advantages of Using Daemons (Background Processes):
- Automatic Management: Daemons can run automatically without user intervention. This is useful for services that need to be running at all times, like web servers, database servers, or background workers.
- Resource Management: Since they run in the background, you can better manage resources (CPU, memory) and keep your terminal free for other tasks.
- Continuous Service Availability: Daemons are perfect for tasks that need to be always on (like Docker itself, which runs the Docker daemon in the background to manage containers).

Disadvantages (or Why Not to Use Daemons):
- Difficult to Debug: If a daemonized process crashes or stops working correctly, it might be harder to troubleshoot since it runs in the background.
- Harder to Monitor: You may not realize if a daemon is misbehaving or consuming too many resources since it's not visible in the foreground.
- Overhead for Simple Tasks: For lightweight tasks that don't need to always be running (like one-time scripts or short-term jobs), using a daemon might add unnecessary complexity.

When to Use Them:
- Good Idea: Use daemons when you need to keep a service running continuously (e.g., a web server, a message broker, or a database service).
- Not a Good Idea: Avoid daemons for quick, one-off jobs or scripts that don't need to stay alive after they finish running.
In Docker's case, the daemon is essential for the system to function. Without it, you wouldn't be able to run containers, manage images, or interact with any of Docker’s features. For other software, whether or not you should use a daemon depends on the use case.

### VM vs Docker -------------------------------
7. Extra: (Virtual Machine vs Docker)

Summary of Differences:

| Feature          | Virtual Machine (VM)                           | Docker (Container)                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Architecture**  | Full guest OS on top of host OS                | Shares host OS kernel, isolated by processes      |
| **Startup Speed** | Slow (minutes)                                 | Fast (seconds)                                   |
| **Resource Usage**| Heavy, each VM needs its own OS                | Lightweight, shares host OS                      |
| **Isolation**     | Full OS isolation (secure, but heavier)        | Process-level isolation, lighter but less isolated|
| **Portability**   | Less portable, larger images (full OS)         | Highly portable, smaller images                  |
| **Performance**   | Slower (due to full OS overhead)               | Faster (less overhead)                           |
| **Use Cases**     | Running multiple OSes, legacy apps, full OS isolation | Microservices, cloud apps, lightweight tasks  |
| **Size of Images**| Large (GBs)                                    | Small (MBs to GBs)                               |

In Summary:
- `Docker (containers)` is more lightweight, faster, and more efficient when running multiple applications on the same machine. It's great for modern app development, where speed, portability, and scalability are key.
- `Virtual machines (VM)` offer more complete isolation and are better suited when you need to run different operating systems or when full OS separation is required.

### .ENV ---------------------------------------

# .env
General
DOMAIN_NAME=jmetzger.42.fr:
This specifies the domain name for the WordPress site. In this case, it seems to be a subdomain (jmetzger) of 42.fr, possibly referring to a user or server identifier.

DB_HOSTNAME=mariadb:
This is the hostname or IP address of the database server (MariaDB in this case). The value mariadb indicates that it expects the database service to be running on the same server or a server accessible by that name (e.g., within a Docker container network).

DB_DATABASE=wordpress:
This sets the name of the MySQL database that will be used for WordPress. The database is named wordpress.

DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=root:
The password for the MySQL root user (the administrative user). Here, it’s set to root (which is a poor security practice, but it might be placeholder text for setup purposes).

Database Administrator
DB_USER=bob:
This creates a MySQL user named bob, which will be the non-root user for interacting with the WordPress database.

DB_USER_PASSWORD=bob:
The password for the bob MySQL user is set to bob.

WordPress Admin (WordPress Backend)
WP_ADMIN=wordpress:
This sets the WordPress admin username to wordpress, which is used to log in to the WordPress dashboard.

WP_ADMIN_PWD=wordpress:
This sets the WordPress admin password to wordpress.

WP_ADMIN_EMAIL=wordpress@gmail.com:
This specifies the email address associated with the WordPress admin account. Here, it's set to wordpress@gmail.com, but this would typically be changed to a real email address during setup.

WordPress User (Frontend User Account)
WP_USR=wp_user:
This is the name of a regular user for the WordPress site, named wp_user. This could be a default user account created during setup.

WP_USER_PWD=wp_user:
The password for the wp_user is set to wp_user.

WP_USRR_EMAIL=user_wordpress@gmail.com:
The email address associated with the regular wp_user account is user_wordpress@gmail.com.

Summary
This configuration defines several key settings for deploying a WordPress instance:

Database connection details (hostname, database name, credentials)
WordPress admin credentials (for managing the site)
A regular user account (presumably for testing the site as a normal user)
Keep in mind, the actual passwords (root, bob, wordpress, etc.) should be changed to something more secure in a real deployment. The file likely serves as part of an environment setup for a WordPress installation, where these variables are injected into scripts or Docker containers to automate the deployment.
Since your DB_USER environment variable is empty when you check it with echo $DB_USER, it indicates that your .env file is not being loaded properly or the variables are not being passed to the Docker container correctly. Here’s how to troubleshoot and fix the issue.

Steps to Resolve the Issue
Check .env File Location:

Ensure your .env file is in the same directory where you run the docker-compose command. Docker Compose looks for the .env file in the project directory by default.
Verify .env Syntax:

Make sure there are no syntax errors in your .env file. For example:
Ensure there are no spaces around the = sign.
Each variable should be on a new line.
Your .env file should look like this:

plaintext
Copy code
# GENERAL
DOMAIN_NAME=jmetzger.42.fr              # Intra user name

# MARIADB DATABASE
DB_DATABASE=maria_database              # Name of the MySQL database that will be used for WordPress
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=root                   # Password your choice 
DB_USER=bob                             # User your choice
DB_USER_PASSWORD=bob                         # Password your choice  

# WORDPRESS ADMIN
WP_ADMIN=wordpress                      # User your choice
WP_ADMIN_PWD=wordpress                  # Password your choice 
WP_ADMIN_EMAIL=wordpress@gmail.com      # Email your choice

# WORDPRESS USER
WP_USR=wp_user                          # User your choice
WP_USER_PWD=wp_user                     # Password your choice 
WP_USRR_EMAIL=user_wordpress@gmail.com  # Email your choice




Your .env file looks good overall, but there are a few points that could be causing issues, especially with MariaDB and WordPress connectivity. Here are some adjustments and clarifications to help ensure smooth operation:

1. Database Host and Naming Conventions
In the .env file, WP_DB_HOST is set to MariaDB, but this should match the service name exactly as it is case-sensitive. Since your docker-compose.yml file uses mariadb (all lowercase) as the service name, you should change:
plaintext
Copy code
WP_DB_HOST=mariadb
This will allow WordPress to locate the MariaDB service correctly.
2. Consistent Variable Naming
For database settings, Docker's WordPress image expects WORDPRESS_DB_HOST, WORDPRESS_DB_USER, and WORDPRESS_DB_USER_PASSWORD environment variables. In your case, you need to rename WP_DB_HOST, DB_USER, and DB_USER_PASSWORD as follows to ensure compatibility:
plaintext
Copy code
WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=mariadb
WORDPRESS_DB_USER=bob
WORDPRESS_DB_USER_PASSWORD=bob
WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=WordPressDB  # This should match your `WP_DATABASE_NAME` setting.
Also, remove WP_DATABASE_NAME and WP_DB_HOST from .env to avoid confusion, as they are not recognized by the WordPress Docker image.
3. Updated .env File
Here’s what your .env file should look like after these adjustments:

plaintext
Copy code
# GENERAL
DOMAIN_NAME=jmetzger.42.fr              # Intra user name

# MARIADB DATABASE
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=root                # Root password for MariaDB
DB_USER=bob                          # User for MariaDB
DB_USER_PASSWORD=bob                      # Password for MariaDB
MYSQL_DATABASE=WordPressDB              # Name of the database for WordPress

# WORDPRESS CONNECTION TO DATABASE
WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=mariadb               # Hostname for MariaDB as set in docker-compose.yml
WORDPRESS_DB_USER=bob                   # MariaDB user WordPress will connect with
WORDPRESS_DB_USER_PASSWORD=bob               # Password for the MariaDB user
WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=WordPressDB           # Database name WordPress will use

# WORDPRESS ADMIN
WP_ADMIN=wordpress                      # Admin username
WP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=wordpress             # Admin password
WP_ADMIN_EMAIL=wordpress@gmail.com      # Admin email

# WORDPRESS USER
WP_USER=wp_user                         # Regular WordPress user
WP_USER_PASSWORD=wp_user                # User password
WP_USER_EMAIL=user_wordpress@gmail.com  # User email
4. Important Note on MYSQL_DATABASE
Adding MYSQL_DATABASE=WordPressDB ensures that MariaDB creates the database WordPress expects on its first run.

5. Restart Docker Compose
After updating the .env file, restart the containers to ensure that the new environment variables are loaded:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
With these adjustments, your containers should work more smoothly together. Use docker-compose logs -f to monitor the logs after making these changes and check if WordPress can successfully connect to MariaDB.



In your docker-compose.yml file, the MariaDB service is defined under the mariadb key, all in lowercase:

yaml
Copy code
services:
  mariadb:  # This is the service name used by Docker
    ...
Docker uses this service name (mariadb) as the hostname for internal network communication between containers. So, to allow WordPress to connect to the MariaDB service, WP_DB_HOST (or ideally WORDPRESS_DB_HOST as per Docker's default WordPress image) in your .env file must be set to mariadb (all lowercase), matching this service name exactly.

Summary of Required Changes:
In your .env file:

plaintext
Copy code
WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=mariadb  # Ensure this is lowercase to match the service name
By doing this, you ensure that WordPress connects to the correct host on Docker's internal network.

### Makefile -----------------------------------

# makefile
```
all:
	@docker-compose -f $(COMPOSE_FILE) up -d --build
```
Purpose: The all target builds and starts the Docker containers.
- `up:` This command starts (or creates, if not already created) the Docker services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
- `-d:` Runs the containers in detached mode, which means the containers will run in the background, and the terminal won't be blocked.
- `--build:` This flag forces the rebuilding of images before starting the services. If there are changes in your Dockerfile or project, they will be included.

```
down:
	@docker-compose -f $(COMPOSE_FILE) down
```
Purpose: The down target stops and removes the running Docker containers, along with any associated networks and temporary resources.
- `down:` This stops the containers and removes all related resources, including networks, volumes (unless explicitly persisted), and containers defined by the docker-compose.yml file.

```
clean: down
	docker system prune -af
	docker volume prune -f
```
Purpose: The clean target stops and removes all Docker containers and associated resources, and then aggressively cleans up unused Docker resources (like unused images, stopped containers, and volumes).
- `docker system prune -af:` This command removes all unused Docker objects (such as dangling images, stopped containers, and unused networks). The -a flag ensures that all unused images (not just dangling ones) are removed, and the -f flag forces it without asking for confirmation.
- `docker volume prune -f:` This removes all unused Docker volumes. The -f flag forces it without a prompt.

Both makefiles work:

```Makefile
# Paths
COMPOSE_FILE	=	./scrs/docker-compose.yml

# --- Targets ---

	docker system prune -af
	docker volume prune -f

.PHONY: all down re clean

### Docker-compose.yml -------------------------

# docker-compse.yml

1. General Overview
This Docker Compose file defines a multi-container application that consists of three main services:

MariaDB: The database service.
Nginx: The web server that will serve the website.
WordPress: The WordPress application itself.
The volumes and networks help manage data persistence and network communication between these services.

2. Detailed Explanation of Volumes
Volumes and Their Purpose:
Why volumes?
Docker containers are designed to be ephemeral (short-lived), meaning that any data generated within the container during runtime will be lost once the container is stopped or removed. Volumes are used to persist important data outside of the container, ensuring that it survives container reboots or even complete removals.

Why use bind mounts?
Bind mounts allow you to map a specific directory on the host machine to a directory in the container. This is especially useful for persistent data storage, like the MySQL database and WordPress content (uploads, themes, plugins). In your case:

MariaDB: Needs to persist its database data.
WordPress: Needs to persist website content, like uploads, themes, and plugins.

      o: bind                               # Bind mounts the host directory to the container
      device: /home/jmetzger/data/mysql     # This is the host directory where MariaDB will persist its database files

  wordpress:
    name: wordpress                         # Defines the volume name as "wordpress"
    driver: local                           # Volume is located on the local host system
    driver_opts:
      type: none                            # No special filesystem type is enforced
      o: bind                               # Bind mounts the host directory to the container
      device: /home/jmetzger/data/html      # This is the host directory where WordPress files (themes, plugins, uploads) will be stored
```
3. Why Each Part is Necessary
MariaDB Volume (mariadb:/var/lib/mysql):

Reason: MariaDB stores the actual database files in /var/lib/mysql within the container. By binding this to a host directory, you ensure that your databases are persistent across container restarts. Without this, any database data would be lost when the container stops.
WordPress Volume (wordpress:/var/www/html):

Reason: WordPress stores files such as themes, plugins, and uploads in /var/www/html. By binding this directory to the host, your WordPress website's content persists even when the container is restarted or removed.
Nginx Volume (nginx:/var/www/html):

Optional Use Case: If you need to store static files, custom configurations, or logs, you can bind mount a directory for Nginx. Since you're using WordPress and Nginx is just serving it, this may not be necessary unless you're doing something like custom Nginx configurations.
Conclusion
Volumes ensure that critical data (like the MariaDB database and WordPress content) persists across container restarts.
Networks allow your containers to communicate with each other internally on a dedicated Docker network.
Service Definitions detail how each container should be built, managed, and restarted.
This setup provides a robust architecture for running a WordPress site backed by MariaDB with Nginx acting as a reverse proxy, ensuring data persistence and internal communication.






You said:
what are these?
version: "3.8"

services:
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In a Docker Compose file, the version and services keys are essential components that define the structure of your multi-container Docker application. Here's a detailed explanation of what they are:

1. version
The version key specifies the version of the Compose file format you're using. This is important because different versions support different features. In your case, you've specified version: "3.8", which is part of the Docker Compose version 3 family.

Why version matters:
It determines what features and syntax are available in your Compose file.
Docker Compose version 3.x is widely used for modern applications, especially for deploying in production environments, and is compatible with Docker Swarm.
Version 3.8 specifically adds support for newer features and configurations, but still maintains backward compatibility with previous 3.x versions.
2. services
The services key defines all the individual services (containers) that make up your application. Each service runs in its own container and represents a specific part of your application.

Each service corresponds to a container.
In your example, under services, you define three services: mariadb, nginx, and wordpress. Each one represents a different container that is built and managed by Docker Compose.
Breakdown of services
mariadb:

This service defines a MariaDB container (the database).
It will be used to store and serve data for your WordPress application.
nginx:

This service defines an Nginx container (the web server).
Nginx acts as a reverse proxy that handles web traffic and directs it to the WordPress service.
wordpress:

This service defines a WordPress container (the application).
It will run the actual WordPress site, and it depends on the MariaDB database for data storage.
Example Structure:
```yaml
version: "3.8"           # Defines the version of the Docker Compose file format being used

services:                 # Defines the application services (containers) 
  mariadb:                # This is the MariaDB service (container)
    ...

  nginx:                  # This is the Nginx service (container)
    ...

  wordpress:              # This is the WordPress service (container)
    ...
```
Each of the services under services: will have its own specific configuration, such as:

Images (what Docker image to use)
Volumes (how to persist data)
Ports (what ports to expose)
Networks (how the service connects to other services)
In summary:

version: Specifies the Docker Compose file format.
services: Defines the different parts (containers) of your application that will work together to create a multi-container environment.
These two keys are critical in setting up a Docker Compose environment that ties together multiple containers into a functioning application.

1. What is the networks section?
The networks section in a Docker Compose file defines the networking configuration for your containers. Docker uses networks to allow containers to communicate with each other. Containers that are connected to the same network can talk to each other directly, using their container names as hostnames.

In Docker Compose, you can define custom networks so that specific services can communicate privately and securely.
By default, Docker Compose creates a network for you, but it's a good practice to define your own networks for better control, especially in more complex applications.
2. What is the inception network in your example?
The inception network is a custom network that you’ve defined in your Docker Compose file. All the services (containers) in your file — mariadb, nginx, and wordpress — are connected to this network, which allows them to communicate with each other.

yaml
Copy code
networks:              # Define custom networks for the services
  inception:           # Custom network named "inception"
    name: inception    # The actual network name is "inception"
inception: This is the name of the network within the Compose file. It's just an identifier.
name: inception: This specifies the actual name of the network that Docker will create. In this case, the name is "inception."
When Docker Compose runs, it creates this network and attaches the containers that use it to the network. This way, the mariadb, nginx, and wordpress containers can communicate because they are all attached to the same network.

3. Why do you need a custom network?
Internal Communication: All services in your Compose file (mariadb, nginx, and wordpress) are connected to the inception network. This allows the services to communicate internally using container names as hostnames (e.g., the WordPress service can talk to MariaDB by using mariadb as the hostname).

Isolation and Security: Custom networks ensure that services are isolated from other containers running outside of this Compose setup. Other Docker containers that are not on the inception network cannot communicate with the services defined here.

Easy Service Discovery: Docker automatically provides service discovery on custom networks. For example, in your WordPress container, if you set DB_HOSTNAME: mariadb, Docker will know to resolve mariadb to the correct container's IP address because both services are on the same inception network.

4. How is it used in your services?
In each service (MariaDB, Nginx, WordPress), the networks section specifies that the container should be connected to the inception network:

yaml
Copy code
services:
  mariadb:
    ...
    networks:
      - inception        # Connect MariaDB to the "inception" network

  nginx:
    ...
    networks:
      - inception        # Connect Nginx to the "inception" network

  wordpress:
    ...
    networks:
      - inception        # Connect WordPress to the "inception" network
This ensures that:

MariaDB, WordPress, and Nginx can communicate with each other internally on the inception network.
The services are isolated from other Docker containers not connected to the same network.
5. When would you use multiple networks?
In more complex applications, you might want to define multiple networks to control how different services interact. For example:

Frontend and Backend Networks: You could have an internal network for sensitive services (like databases) and an external network for web-facing services. This would prevent unnecessary exposure of your database to the internet-facing containers.
In your case, using a single custom network, inception, simplifies communication between all services while keeping them isolated from other Docker containers running on your system.

Summary
networks: Defines the network(s) that services can use to communicate.
Custom Network (inception): Allows your services (MariaDB, Nginx, WordPress) to communicate privately and securely.
Service Discovery: Containers can reach each other by name (e.g., WordPress can reach MariaDB by using mariadb as the hostname).
Isolation: Services are isolated from other Docker containers not in the inception network.
By explicitly defining the inception network, you're ensuring all services can talk to each other while remaining secure and isolated from any other containers running outside of this application.




The args section in your Docker Compose file is important, but its significance depends on how you're building your Docker image. Here's a detailed explanation:

What are args in Docker Compose?
args are build-time variables used to pass values into the build process when Docker is constructing an image. They are defined in the Dockerfile and can be supplied during the docker build process.
They are different from environment variables (env or env_file), which are runtime variables that containers use while they are running. args only affect the image-building stage, not the actual running container.
Example in Your Case:
yaml
Copy code
args:
  DB_DATABASE : ${DB_DATABASE}
  DB_USER : $DB_USER
  DB_USER_PASSWORD : $DB_USER_PASSWORD
  DB_ROOT_PASSWORD : $DB_ROOT_PASSWORD
In this section, the args are passing the database details (like the database name, user, and password) to the build process when Docker creates the MariaDB image.
These values come from environment variables (typically defined in the .env file), and Docker substitutes them during the build phase.
Are args important?
Yes, if you're building custom images. If your Dockerfile is designed to use these args during the image build process, then they are necessary for the successful build of the image.

For example:

If your Dockerfile for MariaDB in requirements/mariadb uses these arguments (e.g., setting default environment variables or configuring certain behaviors in the image), then the args are essential for building the image with the correct database setup.

In a typical Dockerfile, you might see something like this:

Dockerfile
Copy code
ARG DB_DATABASE
ARG DB_USER
ARG DB_USER_PASSWORD
ARG DB_ROOT_PASSWORD

# Use these ARG values to set up the MariaDB configuration at build-time.
If you're using a pre-built image (like the official mariadb image) and don't need to customize it at build time, the args section may not be necessary. Instead, you would only need to use environment variables (env_file or environment) to configure MariaDB at runtime.

If you’re using a pre-built MariaDB image
If you're simply using the official mariadb image and not customizing it with a custom Dockerfile in requirements/mariadb, the args section may be redundant. In that case, you can pass all configuration using the environment variables at runtime:

Using env_file: You already have this in your Compose file, where the environment variables are loaded from .env and passed to the container at runtime.
Should you keep args?
If you're building a custom MariaDB image from the requirements/mariadb directory (where you have a Dockerfile that uses these args), then you should keep them. They ensure the image is built with the correct settings.

If you're using a pre-built image (like image: mariadb from Docker Hub) and you're not building a custom image, you likely don't need the args section. You can rely solely on env_file or environment variables to pass configuration when the container starts.

To summarize:
args are important if you're building a custom Docker image from a Dockerfile and need to pass certain configuration options during the build process.
If you're using pre-built images, you probably don’t need args and can configure the container using environment variables (env_file).
Check if you have a Dockerfile in requirements/mariadb. If it uses ARG instructions, the args are necessary. If not, you might be able to remove them.





how do I know what a docker-compose.yml needs?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To understand what your docker-compose.yml file needs, you should focus on what your application requires to run properly within a Docker environment. This will depend on the architecture of your app, the services it needs, and how those services should interact. Here's a step-by-step guide to figuring out what your docker-compose.yml file needs:

1. Understand Your Application’s Components
The first step is to break down the components of your application. For example, in the case of a typical web application, you may need:

A web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache).
An application server (e.g., WordPress, Django, Node.js).
A database (e.g., MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
Other dependencies (e.g., Redis, a caching server, or message queues).
You need to determine which services your application requires. In your current example, the components are:

MariaDB: A database for storing data.
WordPress: The actual application (web-based content management system).
Nginx: A web server to handle traffic and serve the WordPress application.
2. Determine Container Requirements for Each Component
Once you know the services, determine what each container needs. Think about:

Docker images: Which Docker images should be used for each service? Should you use pre-built images (e.g., from Docker Hub) or build custom ones from a Dockerfile?

In your example, you use images like mariadb, nginx, and wordpress.
Volumes: Does the service need persistent storage? Some services, like databases, need volumes to store data so that it's not lost when the container restarts.

Example: MariaDB and WordPress need volumes to persist their data across container restarts.
Ports: What ports need to be exposed to access the services externally?

Example: Nginx may expose port 443 to serve your web application over HTTPS.
Environment Variables: Does the service need environment variables to be configured, like database credentials?

Example: MariaDB needs variables like DB_USER, DB_USER_PASSWORD, and DB_DATABASE to set up the database.
3. Services Section
For each component, you define a service. A service represents a container and its associated configuration.

Image: What Docker image will be used (e.g., mariadb, wordpress, or nginx)?
Build: If you need a custom image, you specify a build section that tells Docker Compose where to find the Dockerfile.
Environment Variables: What configuration does the container need at runtime? For instance, databases need credentials.
Volumes: Do you need to store data persistently or share files between the container and the host?
Ports: Which ports need to be mapped between the host and the container?
4. Networking Configuration
Think about how your containers should communicate with each other. You often need to create a custom network in Docker Compose to allow your services to interact securely.

Why? Containers on the same network can communicate using their service names as hostnames.
Example: Your nginx container might talk to wordpress, and WordPress might need to talk to the mariadb container for database access.
5. Volumes for Data Persistence
Some services, like databases and CMS platforms (e.g., WordPress), need to persist data. You should configure volumes to ensure data is not lost when containers are restarted or rebuilt.

Why? Without volumes, any data created inside a container will be lost when the container is stopped or destroyed.
Example: MariaDB needs a volume to persist its database files, and WordPress needs a volume to persist its content files.
6. Handling Dependencies Between Services
Some services depend on others. For example, WordPress needs the MariaDB service to be up before it can start.

Use depends_on: You can specify dependencies between services using the depends_on key in Docker Compose. This ensures services start in the correct order.
yaml
Copy code
depends_on:
  - mariadb    # Ensure MariaDB is started before WordPress
7. Use Environment Files for Configuration
To avoid hardcoding sensitive configuration values (like database passwords) directly in your docker-compose.yml, use an .env file.

Why? This keeps your Compose file clean and allows you to easily change configuration settings without editing the file itself.
Example: You can use .env to set variables like DB_USER, DB_USER_PASSWORD, and DB_DATABASE.
yaml
Copy code
env_file:
  - .env       # Load environment variables from an .env file
8. Restart Policies
You should define how Docker should handle container restarts. Use the restart policy to define whether containers should be automatically restarted if they crash.

yaml
Copy code
restart: unless-stopped    # Restart the container unless it is explicitly stopped
9. Special Features or Requirements
Lastly, consider if your application has any specific requirements, such as:

Ports: You may need to expose certain ports (e.g., 443 for HTTPS or 80 for HTTP).
Logging: You may want to configure logging or other monitoring tools.
Scaling: If you need multiple instances of a service, you can specify a number of replicas in Docker Compose.
Example: Building a Docker Compose File
Here’s how you’d build a docker-compose.yml file based on the requirements:

yaml
Copy code
version: "3.8"

services:
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb
    container_name: mariadb
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - .env              # Load environment variables from .env file
    volumes:
      - mariadb:/var/lib/mysql  # Persist MariaDB data
    networks:
      - app_network        # Connect to the custom network

  wordpress:
    image: wordpress
    container_name: wordpress
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - mariadb            # Start MariaDB before WordPress
    env_file:
      - .env               # Load environment variables from .env file
    volumes:
      - wordpress:/var/www/html  # Persist WordPress content
    networks:
      - app_network        # Connect to the custom network

  nginx:
    image: nginx
    container_name: nginx
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - wordpress          # Start Nginx after WordPress
    ports:
      - "443:443"          # Expose port 443 (HTTPS)
    networks:
      - app_network        # Connect to the custom network

networks:
  app_network:
    name: inception        # Custom network for the app

volumes:
  mariadb:
    driver: local          # Local storage for MariaDB data
  wordpress:
    driver: local          # Local storage for WordPress content
Summary of What to Include:
Services:

Define all services (databases, web servers, etc.).
Use official or custom Docker images.
Set dependencies between services.
Build Requirements:

If building custom images, specify the build context.
Pass args if needed during the image build process.
Configuration:

Use environment variables or files (env_file).
Set up volumes for persistent storage.
Expose necessary ports for services.
Networking:

Define networks to allow inter-service communication.
Restart Policies:

Use appropriate restart policies for container health management.
By focusing on your application’s needs, you can tailor your docker-compose.yml file to ensure each service is properly configured, communicates securely, and can be easily managed.




Your docker-compose file is close to correct, but a few issues could be causing errors in the logs. Here’s an analysis of potential problem areas and recommended fixes:

1. Structure and Indentation
Make sure the indentation is consistent. YAML is very sensitive to indentation. In your file, double-check for spaces versus tabs, as they can often cause issues.

2. docker-compose Version Declaration
Most docker-compose files start with a version declaration. While it’s not always required, adding one can ensure compatibility:

yaml
Copy code
version: '3.8'  # or another version compatible with your Docker setup
3. Environment Variables in .env
Ensure your .env file includes all necessary environment variables, specifically for:

DB_ROOT_PASSWORD
MYSQL_DATABASE
DB_USER
DB_USER_PASSWORD
WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
WORDPRESS_DB_USER
WORDPRESS_DB_USER_PASSWORD
4. Database Connection (WORDPRESS_DB_HOST)
For WORDPRESS_DB_HOST, specify mariadb as the hostname in the .env file. It should look something like:

plaintext
Copy code
WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=mariadb:3306
Docker’s internal DNS resolves service names within the same network.

5. depends_on Directive
depends_on manages startup order but doesn’t guarantee a service is ready. You might be seeing errors because WordPress starts before MariaDB is fully ready. For MariaDB, you could add a healthcheck like so:

yaml
Copy code
    mariadb:
      ...
      healthcheck:
        test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
        interval: 10s
        timeout: 5s
        retries: 5
6. NGINX Volume Configuration
Your NGINX service’s volume section includes wordpress:/var/www/html, which might conflict since this is generally handled by the WordPress container alone. Unless NGINX needs access to specific WordPress files (like static assets), you may want to remove this volume reference from NGINX.

7. Permissions and Ownership of Host Folders
Ensure that the directories ${HOME}/data/mariadb and ${HOME}/data/wordpress have correct permissions and ownership to allow Docker to bind these directories without issues:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ${HOME}/data/mariadb
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ${HOME}/data/wordpress
8. Example Revised docker-compose File
Here is an updated version with some of the recommended changes applied:

yaml
Copy code
version: '3.8'

services:
  mariadb:
    build: requirements/mariadb
    container_name: mariadb
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - mariadb:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - inception
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  wordpress:
    build: requirements/wordpress
    container_name: wordpress
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - wordpress:/var/www/html
    networks:
      - inception

  nginx:
    build: requirements/nginx
    container_name: nginx
    depends_on:
      - wordpress
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - .env
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    networks:
      - inception

networks:
  inception:
    name: inception
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  mariadb:
    name: mariadb
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      o: bind
      device: ${HOME}/data/mariadb

  wordpress:
    name: wordpress
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      o: bind
      device: ${HOME}/data/wordpress
After making these changes, restart your services by running:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
Then monitor logs with docker-compose logs -f to see if the errors are resolved.

The difference between a docker-compose.yml file and a Dockerfile lies in their purposes and roles within Docker-based development environments:

1. Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a set of instructions used to build a Docker image. It defines everything needed to assemble the image, such as the base image, dependencies, configurations, and file structures. The image created from the Dockerfile can then be run as a container.

Key Points:
Purpose: To create a custom Docker image.
Usage: Defines how to build a single container image.
Syntax: Uses instructions like FROM, RUN, COPY, CMD, and others to describe what goes into the image.
Basic Example of a Dockerfile:
Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use an official Python runtime as a base image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define the command to run the app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
What it does:
Pulls the Python 3.9 base image.
Copies local files into the container.
Installs Python dependencies.
Specifies the command to run the app.
2. docker-compose.yml
A docker-compose.yml file is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to manage multiple services, networks, and volumes in one place. While the Dockerfile defines how to build a single image, docker-compose.yml defines how to orchestrate multiple containers.

Key Points:
Purpose: To define and manage multi-container applications.
Usage: Specifies how to configure, connect, and manage multiple services, networks, and volumes.
Syntax: YAML-based configuration that specifies services, networks, volumes, environment variables, and more.
Basic Example of a docker-compose.yml:
yaml
Copy code
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
What it does:
Defines two services: web and db.
Builds a custom image for the web service (e.g., from the Dockerfile).
Uses the official postgres image for the db service.
Links the services together so they can communicate.
Key Differences
Feature	Dockerfile	docker-compose.yml
Purpose	Defines how to build a single Docker image.	Defines how to run and manage multi-container Docker applications.
Scope	Focuses on building a single image.	Focuses on managing the configuration of multiple containers.
File Format	Shell-like script, with commands like RUN, COPY, CMD.	YAML configuration format for services, networks, volumes, etc.
Use Case	Used when you need to build a custom image.	Used when you want to orchestrate multiple services (like web and database) working together.
Image Creation	Builds a Docker image from the instructions.	Uses prebuilt images or builds from a Dockerfile.
Service Management	Cannot manage multiple containers directly.	Defines how services interact, their networks, and volumes.
Dependencies	No concept of dependencies between containers.	Can define dependencies between services (e.g., depends_on).
Networks and Volumes	Cannot define networks or volumes.	Can define custom networks and volumes for services.
Example Usage	Building a Python app or Node.js server image.	Running a web app with Nginx, MySQL, and Redis in separate containers.
How They Work Together
In many cases, docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile are used together:

Dockerfile is used to build a custom image with your application and its dependencies.
docker-compose.yml is used to define and manage multiple services (containers) and how they interact (e.g., a web app, database, caching service, etc.).
Workflow Example:
Create a Dockerfile: Define how to build your application container.
Create a docker-compose.yml: Use this file to start your custom container (from the Dockerfile) along with other services like databases, caches, etc.
Run docker-compose up: Compose will start the multiple containers, build images if needed, and manage the whole application.
When to Use What:
Use Dockerfile when you need to create a custom Docker image for your application (e.g., a web app with dependencies).
Use docker-compose.yml when you need to manage multiple services, connect containers, define networks, and orchestrate how containers work together.
In essence, Dockerfile is for building images, and docker-compose.yml is for running and managing containers in a multi-service environment.


Let’s break down your Dockerfile for WordPress and address its correctness and functionality. Here's a more detailed explanation of each part:

1. Base Image Selection:
dockerfile
Copy code
# Use Debian as a base image (Debian 12)
FROM debian:bookworm
What it does:
This line sets the base image for your container to Debian 12 (Bookworm). Since your requirement was to use the penultimate stable version of Debian, this is correct for now (as the latest would be "Debian 13").
Why it matters:
Using Debian ensures you have a stable, general-purpose Linux distribution with access to extensive software packages. It also allows for optimizations specific to Debian’s package management system (apt).
2. Updating the Package Manager and Installing Dependencies:
dockerfile
Copy code
# Update & install your package manager
RUN apt-get -y update && \
	apt-get install php-fpm php-mysql -y && \
	apt-get install curl -y
What it does:

apt-get -y update updates the package manager's local cache of available packages.
apt-get install php-fpm php-mysql -y installs php-fpm (FastCGI Process Manager) and php-mysql (PHP extension for MySQL). These are essential for running WordPress: php-fpm handles PHP processes, and php-mysql allows PHP to communicate with MySQL/MariaDB databases.
apt-get install curl -y installs curl, a tool used to transfer data from or to a server. It’s useful for downloading WordPress during setup or handling other external requests.
Why it matters:

The php-fpm and php-mysql packages are critical for serving PHP files and connecting to the MariaDB database in your setup. Without these, the WordPress container cannot function properly.
3. Copying the Custom WordPress Setup Script:
dockerfile
Copy code
COPY ./tools/wp-script.sh /
What it does:

This copies the script wp-script.sh from the tools directory on your local machine into the container’s root directory (/).
The script likely contains custom steps to set up WordPress, such as downloading WordPress files, setting correct permissions, or initializing the environment.
Why it matters:

Scripts like this can automate the setup of WordPress, handling tasks that otherwise would have to be done manually. It provides a repeatable way to configure the container correctly.
Ensure that this script is executable by setting the right permissions with chmod +x.
4. Exposing Port 9000:
dockerfile
Copy code
# Make port 9000 available to the wor### --------------------------------------------ld outside this container
EXPOSE 9000
What it does:

This line tells Docker to expose port 9000 of the container, which is the port on which php-fpm will listen. This is the port that NGINX will use to communicate with WordPress (via PHP-FPM).
Why it matters:

Exposing this port is necessary for other services (like NGINX in this case) to connect to this container. Without exposing it, no other container or external service could interact with the PHP-FPM process running inside this container.
5. Defining the Command to Run:
dockerfile
Copy code
# Define the command to run the app
CMD ["/.wp-script.sh"]
What it does:

This defines the default command that runs when the container starts. In this case, it is set to run your wp-script.sh script, which presumably sets up and configures WordPress.
However, there is a mistake here: the path /./wp-script.sh is incorrect; it should be /wp-script.sh (since the script was copied to the root directory).
Why it matters:

The CMD directive is essential for ensuring that the container performs its intended function when it starts. If this script is not correctly defined, the container will fail to start or work improperly.
In your case, the correct path would be /wp-script.sh because the script was copied to the root directory (/).
Suggested Corrections:
Fix the path for the startup script:

The path in CMD should be /wp-script.sh, not /.wp-script.sh.
Ensure PHP-FPM is started correctly:

php-fpm should be started to handle PHP requests. You can add a line in the script to start php-fpm or directly start it in the CMD.
You could modify the CMD directive to start php-fpm and also execute the WordPress setup script.
Here’s a revised version of the Dockerfile:

dockerfile
Copy code
# Use Debian as a base image (Debian 12)
FROM debian:bookworm

# Update & install necessary packages
RUN apt-get -y update && \
    apt-get install -y php-fpm php-mysql curl && \
    apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the WordPress setup script
COPY ./tools/wp-script.sh /

# Make sure the script is executable
RUN chmod +x /wp-script.sh

# Expose port 9000 for PHP-FPM
EXPOSE 9000

# Start PHP-FPM and run the custom WordPress script
CMD ["/bin/bash", "/wp-script.sh"]
Explanation of Changes:
Added chmod +x: Ensures that the wp-script.sh file is executable inside the container.
Fixed the CMD path: Changed CMD to /wp-script.sh and used bash to execute it properly.
Included php-fpm handling: Ensure that php-fpm is running in your wp-script.sh file or separately configure php-fpm to run in the CMD section.
Make sure your wp-script.sh does everything necessary to prepare WordPress, including downloading the WordPress files if they are not in the image already, configuring wp-config.php, and starting php-fpm. Here's an example of what it might include:

### --------------------------------------------


---



# wordpress

### dockerfile ----------------------------------
- Use Debian as a base image (Debian 12)
- Update & intstall your package manager (RUN)
- Copy `wp-config.php` & `wp-script.sh` script from 'tools' directory into the container’s root directory (/). (COPY)
- Make sure the script is executable (NOT necessary for 'wp-config.php', since PHP just reads it) (RUN)
- Expose port 9000 (EXPOSE)
- Start PHP-FPM and run the custom WordPress script (CMD)




The issue where the mysqladmin command cannot be found suggests that mysql-client is still not installed or correctly configured in your WordPress Docker container.
The error you're encountering indicates that the mysql-client package is unavailable in the Debian 12 (Bookworm) repositories, which is causing the apt-get command to fail during the build process. Specifically, the package mysql-client is no longer available under that name in newer versions of Debian, including Bookworm.

Solution: Use the Correct MySQL Client Package
In recent versions of Debian, the MySQL client package has been replaced with mariadb-client. Since you are using MariaDB in your stack, the correct package to install would be mariadb-client instead of mysql-client.
### --------------------------------------------



is it okay that this is happening now in the dockerfile instead of the script.sh?
# Download WP-CLI directly into the /usr/local/bin directory
RUN curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar && \
    chmod +x wp-cli.phar && \
    mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp

Yes, it's perfectly fine—and actually quite good practice—to move the WP-CLI installation steps to the Dockerfile instead of handling them in script.sh. Here’s why this adjustment is beneficial:

Efficiency: By including WP-CLI installation in the Dockerfile, Docker caches this step in the image. This way, WP-CLI doesn't have to be downloaded each time you start a new container, which speeds up container startup.

Cleaner Script: script.sh now focuses only on the WordPress setup and configuration tasks, making it simpler and easier to debug.

Reduced Network Dependency: Since the WP-CLI download and installation occur during the build phase, this step only needs internet access once. Future builds and deployments of this container won't rely on the WP-CLI download server, which improves reliability.

Revised Dockerfile and Script Overview
With the WP-CLI installation in the Dockerfile, here’s a streamlined flow:

Dockerfile: Installs the necessary dependencies and downloads WP-CLI. This creates a reliable base image with everything WordPress needs.
script.sh: Uses WP-CLI to configure and start WordPress, now assuming WP-CLI is already installed and available.
In summary, this approach is both robust and more efficient. Your current setup looks good—let it build and run, and watch for any further configuration logs to confirm everything's working end-to-end!



3. Fix the PHP-FPM executable issue
The error /wp-script.sh: line 45: /usr/sbin/php-fpm7.4: No such file or directory indicates that the php-fpm7.4 executable doesn't exist. This may happen because the version specified (php-fpm7.4) is not installed in your container.

Instead of using php-fpm7.4, simply use php-fpm (which will default to the latest installed version of PHP-FPM). Update your wp-script.sh to use this:

bash
Copy code
exec /usr/sbin/php-fpm -F
This will start PHP-FPM without specifying a version number, ensuring it uses the installed PHP-FPM version.



Important Considerations:

Make sure that your wp-script.sh does two critical things:
Install and Configure WordPress: Download WordPress, configure database credentials (through wp-config.php), and ensure that WordPress files are in the right place.
Start PHP-FPM: It should start the php-fpm process to handle incoming PHP requests. If php-fpm isn't started, the container will not be able to serve any requests.
Example of wp-script.sh:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Download and unpack WordPress if not already present
if [ ! -f /var/www/html/wp-config.php ]; then
  echo "Downloading WordPress..."
  curl -O https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
  tar -xzf latest.tar.gz -C /var/www/html --strip-components=1
  rm latest.tar.gz
  echo "WordPress downloaded and extracted."
fi

# Move the custom wp-config.php into place
mv /wp-config.php /var/www/html/wp-config.php

# Start PHP-FPM in the foreground
echo "Starting PHP-FPM..."
php-fpm7.4 -F
Explanation of the Script:
Download and Extract WordPress:

It checks if wp-config.php already exists in the /var/www/html directory (where WordPress files should reside). If it doesn't, the script downloads and extracts WordPress.
Move wp-config.php:

This moves your custom wp-config.php to the correct location inside the WordPress directory (/var/www/html).
Start PHP-FPM:

The php-fpm7.4 -F command starts the php-fpm service and keeps it running in the foreground (-F). This is essential for the container to keep running and handle PHP requests.


could i also do this?
CMD ["/wp-script.sh"]

instead of this 
CMD ["/bin/bash", "/wp-script.sh"]?

Yes, you can use the following:

dockerfile
Copy code
CMD ["/wp-script.sh"]
Key Differences and Considerations:
Direct Execution vs. Using Bash:

CMD ["/wp-script.sh"]: This attempts to run the wp-script.sh directly. For this to work, the script needs to have a proper "shebang" (#!/bin/bash or #!/bin/sh) at the top. The shebang tells the system which interpreter (like bash or sh) to use when running the script. If the shebang is missing, the system may not know how to execute the script.

Example of a proper shebang at the start of the script:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
CMD ["/bin/bash", "/wp-script.sh"]: This explicitly runs the script with bash. Even if the shebang is missing or if the script isn’t marked executable, this ensures the script is run by bash.

When to use each:

Use CMD ["/wp-script.sh"] if:
Your script has a proper shebang (#!/bin/bash or #!/bin/sh) at the top.
The script is marked executable (chmod +x /wp-script.sh).
Use CMD ["/bin/bash", "/wp-script.sh"] if:
You want to ensure the script runs with bash no matter what.
You don’t need the script to be executable (though it's still a good practice to make it executable).

1. Generating the Authentication Keys and Salts for wp-config.php
The values for AUTH_KEY, SECURE_AUTH_KEY, etc., are security keys and salts that WordPress uses for encrypting information stored in user cookies. You can generate new ones using the [WordPress Secret Key Generator](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/). Simply visit that URL, and it will provide a unique set of values. Copy and paste these into your wp-config.php file where you see the keys and salts defined.


### --------------------------------------------
### Test wordpress -----------------------------

To test if your WordPress setup is working in Docker, you need to ensure that the WordPress container is up and accessible. Since Nginx and MariaDB are not yet configured, you can follow these steps to test WordPress in isolation:

Verify the Container is Running
Run the command below to check if the container is running as expected:

bash
Copy code
docker ps
Look for a container with the name or image name matching wordpress. If it's not running, you may need to troubleshoot the Dockerfile.

Check Container Logs
Inspect the WordPress container logs to see if there are any errors. Run:

bash
Copy code
docker logs wordpress
This can help you identify issues if the container starts but fails internally.

Set up Temporary PHP Server for WordPress Testing
Since you don't yet have Nginx configured, use PHP’s built-in server in the WordPress container to check if WordPress loads. First, connect to the container:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it wordpress bash
Then navigate to the directory where WordPress is located (usually /var/www/html for Dockerized WordPress), and run the built-in PHP server:

bash
Copy code
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
might to install:
Command 'php' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo apt install php8.3-cli  # version 8.3.6-0ubuntu0.24.04.2, or
sudo apt install php-cli     # version 2:8.2+93ubuntu1
sudo apt install php8.2-cli  # version 8.2.12-1ubuntu2

This will start a web server on port 8000 inside the container.

Access WordPress Locally
In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:8000. You should see the WordPress setup page if everything is working correctly within the container.

Next Steps
Once this is working, you can set up Nginx and MariaDB, reconfigure the WordPress container to connect to them, and test the complete setup.

Start PHP Built-in Server: If your Docker container is already set to start PHP-FPM, you might need to ensure that you also expose a port for the built-in server. Since you're using a Dockerfile with PHP-FPM, you might want to run PHP's built-in server as follows:

Option A: Modify Your Dockerfile to Run PHP Built-in Server
You can change your CMD in the Dockerfile or run the built-in server directly in the terminal after accessing your container. Here’s an example of how you might modify the last line in your Dockerfile to run the PHP server:

dockerfile
Copy code
CMD ["php", "-S", "0.0.0.0:8000", "-t", "/var/www/html/wordpress"]
This will start the PHP built-in server and serve files from the specified directory.

Option B: Running it in the Terminal
If you want to start the PHP built-in server manually, you can do the following:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it your_wordpress_container_name bash
cd /var/www/html/wordpress
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000

Your setup is almost correct, but there are a few improvements and fixes needed. I’ll go over each file, pointing out issues and improvements.

1. Dockerfile for WordPress Container
Your Dockerfile is mostly correct but has a few points to check:

Directory Structure: Make sure the directory /var/www/html exists and has appropriate permissions. If it doesn’t, WordPress installation may fail.
Environment Variables in wp-config.php: Your wp-config.php relies on environment variables like ${WP_DATABASE_NAME}. But PHP won’t directly replace those. You may need to use a tool like envsubst or add commands in the script to replace placeholders.
Here’s an adjusted Dockerfile:

dockerfile
Copy code
# Use Debian as a base image (Debian 12)
FROM debian:bookworm

# Update & install packages
RUN apt-get -y update && \
    apt-get install -y php-fpm php-mysql curl mariadb-client

# Download WP-CLI
RUN curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar && \
    chmod +x wp-cli.phar && \
    mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp

# Create the directory where WordPress will be installed
RUN mkdir -p /var/www/html && chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html

# Copy the script and config
COPY ./tools/wp-script.sh /
COPY ./tools/wp-config.php /etc/wp-config.php

# Make sure the script is executable
RUN chmod +x /wp-script.sh

# Expose port 9000 for PHP-FPM
EXPOSE 9000

# Run PHP-FPM and the custom script
CMD ["/wp-script.sh"]
2. wp-script.sh Script
Your script seems to cover most requirements, but here are some improvements:

WordPress Path: Ensure the /var/www/html directory exists before running wp core download.
Configuration File Location: In the current setup, you’re using a custom wp-config.php that might not be correctly applied to /var/www/html/wp-config.php. Copy or symlink it to the correct location.
Database Variables: Confirm WP_DATABASE_NAME, DB_USER, DB_USER_PASSWORD, and WP_DATABASE_HOST are correctly sourced from .env.
Here’s an improved version of wp-script.sh:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Wait for MariaDB
echo "Waiting for the database to be ready..."
until mysqladmin ping -h "${WP_DATABASE_HOST}" --silent; do
    sleep 2
done

# Change to WordPress directory
cd /var/www/html

# Download WordPress if not already downloaded
if [ ! -f wp-login.php ]; then 
    echo "Downloading WordPress..."
    wp core download --allow-root
fi

# Copy the wp-config.php if it doesn't already exist
if [ ! -f wp-config.php ]; then
    echo "Copying wp-config.php..."
    cp /etc/wp-config.php wp-config.php
fi

# Install WordPress core
echo "Installing WordPress core..."
wp core install \
    --url="${DOMAIN_NAME}" \
    --title="inception" \
    --admin_user="${WP_ADMIN}" \
    --admin_password="${WP_ADMIN_PASSWORD}" \
    --admin_email="${WP_ADMIN_EMAIL}" \
    --allow-root

# Create additional WordPress user
echo "Creating WordPress user..."
wp user create "${WP_USER}" "${WP_USER_EMAIL}" --user_pass="${WP_USER_PASSWORD}" --allow-root

# Start PHP-FPM in the foreground
echo "Starting PHP-FPM in the foreground..."
exec php-fpm -F
3. wp-config.php (Configuration File)
In your wp-config.php, environment variables aren’t automatically replaced, and the syntax has some issues. PHP doesn’t process ${VAR_NAME} directly in strings. Instead, use getenv() or set environment variables using envsubst during setup.

Update wp-config.php as follows:

php
Copy code
<?php
// ** MySQL settings ** //
define('DB_NAME', getenv('WP_DATABASE_NAME'));
define('DB_USER', getenv('DB_USER'));
define('DB_USER_PASSWORD', getenv('DB_USER_PASSWORD'));
define('DB_HOST', getenv('WP_DATABASE_HOST'));
define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8');
define('DB_COLLATE', '');

// ** Authentication Unique Keys and Salts **
define('AUTH_KEY',         '8EsCDOM}7G%]D<90c]-+TzD%w=_M0CoY1~$5id>.JPO({DW~i}0x!}Z5X2>H|dly');

if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
    define( 'ABSPATH', '/var/www/html' );
}

// Sets up WordPress vars and included files.
require_once ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php';
4. Additional Tips
Permissions: Ensure /var/www/html is writable by www-data user.
Database Connectivity: Ensure MariaDB is accessible using the host specified in WP_DATABASE_HOST. If the WordPress container can't reach the database, it might be due to networking issues or the wrong hostname.
Logs: Use docker-compose logs wordpress to identify specific errors.
After making these changes, restart your containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
Then, monitor the logs with:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs -f wordpress
This should help resolve most issues and get your WordPress container working correctly.

The absence of a database explicitly named mariadb in the SHOW DATABASES output is not an issue unless you expect such a database to exist for your setup. Let me clarify:

Explanation:
Default and User-Created Databases:

The SHOW DATABASES; command lists all databases currently accessible to the logged-in user.
By default, MariaDB does not create a database named mariadb. It typically includes:
information_schema: A system database for metadata.
User-created databases (e.g., WordPressDB in your case).
Your Database WordPressDB:

If WordPressDB is intended to be the database used by WordPress, this is correct and expected.
MariaDB itself does not have a "self-referencing" database; its functionality is tied to these databases and the system metadata.










Confirm both wordpress and mariadb are connected to the same network.
How do I check that?

From the output of docker network inspect inception_net, we can confirm that both the wordpress and mariadb containers are connected to the same network (inception_net). Here's the relevant part of the output:

Key Details from the Network Inspection
Network Name: inception_net
Containers Connected:
wordpress:
IPv4 Address: 172.18.0.3
mariadb:
IPv4 Address: 172.18.0.2
nginx:
IPv4 Address: 172.18.0.4
Confirmation
Both wordpress and mariadb are listed under Containers in the inception_net network.
The IPv4Address assignments confirm that they are reachable on this network (172.18.0.x).





docker exec -it wordpress bash
Edit the /etc/hosts file: Open /etc/hosts with a text editor (e.g., nano or vi):

bash
Copy code
nano /etc/hosts
Add the mariadb entry: Add the following line to /etc/hosts:

Copy code
172.18.0.2    mariadb
Save and exit the editor:

For nano, press CTRL + X, then press Y to confirm, and Enter to save.
Test connectivity: Now try pinging mariadb again from within the WordPress container:

bash
Copy code
ping mariadb










Yes, it looks like the ping command is also not available in your WordPress container by default. This is because many Docker images, especially minimal ones like the official WordPress image, come with a stripped-down set of utilities, and ping may not be included.

To install ping in the WordPress container:
Access the WordPress container: First, open a shell inside your WordPress container:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it wordpress bash
Install iputils-ping: In many Linux distributions (including Debian/Ubuntu, which is what the WordPress Docker image is based on), the ping utility is provided by the iputils-ping package. To install it, run the following command inside the container:

bash
Copy code
apt-get update && apt-get install -y iputils-ping
Test the ping command: After installation, you should be able to ping the mariadb container:

bash
Copy code
ping mariadb
If ping works after this, it means the network connectivity issue between the WordPress and MariaDB containers has been resolved.

Alternative: Use nc (Netcat)
If you're unable or prefer not to install ping, you can also use nc (Netcat) to check if the MariaDB container is accessible from the WordPress container:

Install netcat (if necessary): If the nc command is not available, you can install it with:

bash
Copy code
apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat
Test the connection: Once nc is installed, test the connection to the MariaDB container on port 3306:

bash
Copy code
nc -zv mariadb 3306
This will try to connect to mariadb on port 3306 (the default MySQL/MariaDB port), and it will show whether the connection is successful.

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'wordpress.inception_net' IDENTIFIED BY 'root' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;








docker inspect wordpress




docker exec -it wordpress bash
mysql -h mariadb -u bob -pbob




Verify environment variable substitution in wp-config.php:

Environment variables like ${WP_DATABASE_HOST} may not be substituted correctly in your wp-config.php.
Update the script to replace placeholders directly:
bash
Copy code
sed -i "s/\${WP_DATABASE_NAME}/${WP_DATABASE_NAME}/g" /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
sed -i "s/\${DB_USER}/${DB_USER}/g" /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
sed -i "s/\${DB_USER_PASSWORD}/${DB_USER_PASSWORD}/g" /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
sed -i "s/\${WP_DATABASE_HOST}/${WP_DATABASE_HOST}/g" /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php




RUN sed -i "s|\${WP_DATABASE_NAME}|wordpress|g" /etc/wp-config.php && \
    sed -i "s|\${DB_USER}|bob|g" /etc/wp-config.php && \
    sed -i "s|\${DB_USER_PASSWORD}|bob|g" /etc/wp-config.php && \
    sed -i "s|\${WP_DATABASE_HOST}|mariadb|g" /etc/wp-config.php





Testing the Fixes
Rebuild and restart the containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
Monitor logs:

bash
Copy code
docker logs wordpress -f
Verify functionality by accessing WordPress in your browser:

bash
Copy code
https://<DOMAIN_NAME>
Let me know if you encounter further issues!






4. Test Database Connection from WordPress Container
From the wordpress container, test connectivity to MariaDB:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it wordpress mysql -u bob -pbob -h mariadb -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
Expected output:

text
Copy code
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
| wordpress          |
+--------------------+
If this works, the database connection is functional.

# mariadb
To set up a MariaDB container with custom configuration, you would typically need:
- `Dockerfile` : This defines the MariaDB image build, installing any necessary tools and copying configuration files into the container.
- `Initialization Script (db-script.sh)` : This script initializes the database, sets up users, databases, and permissions, and ensures that MariaDB keeps running in the foreground.
- `Custom Configuration File (custom_config.cnf) `: This file customizes MariaDB’s server settings, like port, bind address, caching, logging, and character sets.

### dockerfile ---------------------------------
- Use Debian as a base image (FROM)
- Update & intstall your package manager (RUN)
- Copy custom MariaDB configuration script AND custom_config.cnf (COPY) 
- Expose port 3306 (EXPOSE)
- Run the MariaDB setup script and start the server in the foreground (CMD)
### --------------------------------------------
### script -------------------------------------
Such a script usually takes care of preparing the environment, initializing the database if necessary, setting up security configurations, creating a database, and ensuring MariaDB runs in the foreground.
Let's go through this MariaDB initialization script step by step:

This is the "shebang" line. It tells the system that the script should be executed using /bin/bash, a common Unix shell.
You alway need this line at the top of your script.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
- Create Necessary Directories and Set Permissions:
MariaDB requires specific directories for data and logs. The script should create these directories and adjust permissions to ensure that the MariaDB process has access to them.
- Check if the Database Directory Exists:
The script checks if the MariaDB data directory is already initialized. If not, it initializes the database.
      - Secure MariaDB Installation:
        This step usually involves securing the MariaDB installation, similar to the interactive mysql_secure_installation command.
        This script segment automates the security questions asked during the mysql_secure_installation. Options include:
            - Setting a root password
            - Removing anonymous users
            - Disallowing root login remotely
            - Removing the test database
            - Reloading privilege tables
        Note: Replace "password" with a secure password of your choice.
      - Create a New Database (if specified):
        If you want to create a new database, you can add a check and run the necessary SQL command.
      - Create a New User and Grant Privileges (if specified):
        If a user and password are provided, the script creates the user and grants the necessary privileges.
            - CREATE USER: Adds a new user with a specified password.
            - GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES: Gives the new user full access to the specified database.
            - FLUSH PRIVILEGES: Refreshes the privilege tables to apply changes.
- Keep MariaDB Running in the Foreground:
To ensure the database service stays active in the foreground (important for containerized environments like Docker).
            - `exec mysqld` replaces the current shell process with the MariaDB server, keeping it running in the foreground.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Create necessary directories and set permissions as root
mkdir -p /run/mysqld /var/log/mysql
chown -R mysql:mysql /run/mysqld /var/log/mysql

# Check if the database directory exists
if [ ! -d "/var/lib/mysql/${WP_DATABASE_NAME}" ]; then
    echo "Initializing MariaDB database..."

    # Secure MariaDB installation
    mysql -u root <<EOF
    -- Set the root password
    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF

    # Create a new database if specified
    if [ -n "$WP_DATABASE_NAME" ]; then
        echo "Creating database: $WP_DATABASE_NAME"
        mysql -u root -p"${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}" -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS \`${WP_DATABASE_NAME}\` CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
    fi

    # Create a new user and grant privileges if specified
    if [ -n "$DB_USER" ] && [ -n "$DB_USER_PASSWORD" ]; then
        echo "Creating user: $DB_USER with access to $WP_DATABASE_NAME"
        mysql -u root -p"${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}" <<EOF
        CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS '${DB_USER}'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '${DB_USER_PASSWORD}';
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON \`${WP_DATABASE_NAME}\`.* TO '${DB_USER}'@'%';
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF
    fi

    echo "Database initialization complete."
else
    echo "Database already exists. Skipping initialization."
fi

# Keep MariaDB running in the foreground
echo "Starting MariaDB in the foreground..."
exec mysqld
```

Environment Variables: 
$DB_NAME, $DB_USER, and $DB_USER_PASSWORD should be set in the environment before running the script, or you can hard-code them (not recommended for security reasons).


### --------------------------------------------
### custom_config.cnf --------------------------

The custom_config.cnf file is a configuration file for the MariaDB server, specifically for setting server-side options that control database behavior, storage, networking, and performance. Let’s break down the main sections and settings:

# Structure of the Configuration File
1) Sections:
Configuration files are organized into sections. Each section starts with a name in square brackets, such as [server], [mysqld], [embedded], etc. The parameters defined under each section apply to that specific component of MariaDB.
2) Key-Value Pairs:
Each setting is defined as a key-value pair, where the key is the configuration option, and the value specifies its setting.

# 1) Sections: General Server Configuration Sections
The configuration file is divided into sections (like [mysqld], [mariadb], etc.) that specify settings for different components of the MariaDB server. Each section can contain specific settings related to that component.
- `[server]` : This section applies to the entire MariaDB server, both for standalone and embedded servers.
- `[mysqld]` : Settings in this section apply only to the mysqld standalone MariaDB server daemon.
- `[embedded]`, `[mariadb]`, `[mariadb-10.3]` : These sections define options specific to embedded servers, MariaDB-specific options, and MariaDB version-specific settings, respectively.

# 2) Key-Value Pairs: Basic Settings
# User and PID file settings
- `user` : Sets the user under which the MariaDB server runs.
- `pid-file` : Path for the PID file, which helps manage the MariaDB process.

# Socket and Port settings
- `socket` : Location of the MariaDB Unix socket file for local connections.
- `port` : Sets the port for TCP/IP connections (default MySQL/MariaDB port).

# Directories settings
- `basedir` : Base directory where MariaDB is installed.
- `datadir` : Directory for storing database files.
- `tmpdir` : Temporary files directory used by the server.
- `lc-messages-dir` : Directory for error messages and translations.

# Network settings
- `bind-address` : Specifies the network interface on which MariaDB listens for incoming connections. Setting this to 0.0.0.0 means it accepts connections from all interfaces.

# Fine Tuning
This section contains various parameters that can fine-tune the performance of the server.
Example parameters:
- `key_buffer_size        = 16M`
- `max_allowed_packet     = 16M`
- `thread_stack           = 192K`
- `thread_cache_size      = 8`
- `myisam_recover_options = BACKUP`
- `max_connections        = 100`
- `table_cache            = 64`
- `thread_concurrency     = 10`

# Query Cache Configuration
- `query_cache_size` : Size of the query cache, which stores results of queries to improve performance.

# Logging and Replication
- `log_error` : Path to the error log file, which is crucial for troubleshooting.
- `expire_logs_days` : Number of days to keep binary logs before they are automatically removed.

# Settings for general logging and slow query logging if desired:
- `general_log_file       = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log`
- `general_log            = 1`
- `slow_query_log_file    = /var/log/mysql/mariadb-slow.log`
- `long_query_time        = 10`
- `log_slow_rate_limit    = 1000`
- `log_slow_verbosity     = query_plan`
- `log-queries-not-using-indexes`

# Replication setup
- `server-id              = 1`
- `log_bin                = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log`
- `max_binlog_size        = 100M`
- `binlog_do_db           = include_database_name`
- `binlog_ignore_db       = exclude_database_name`

# Security Features
Security configurations related to connections and SSL.
Uncomment and configure if required.
- `chroot = /var/lib/mysql/`
- `ssl-ca = /etc/mysql/cacert.pem`
- `ssl-cert = /etc/mysql/server-cert.pem`
- `ssl-key = /etc/mysql/server-key.pem`
- `ssl-cipher = TLSv1.2  # Ensure the latest TLS protocol is used for secure connections.`

# Character Sets
Character set settings to support various languages and symbols.
- `character-set-server` : Defines the default character set for the server.
- `collation-server` : Defines the default collation for string comparison.

# Unix Socket Authentication Plugin
This is for Unix socket authentication, allowing the root user to authenticate without a password when running as the Unix root user.
See https://mariadb.com/kb/en/unix_socket-authentication-plugin/ for details.

### --------------------------------------------
### Test MariaDB -------------------------------
Navigate to the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` and run the following command:

RUN:
(Build your container):
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
-> The -d flag runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

(Check the Running Services): 
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

(View Logs):
```bash
docker-compose logs mariadb
```

(Accessing the MariaDB Instance):
Might need to install `sudo apt install mysql-client-core-8.0`
```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u "$DB_USER" -p"$DB_USER_PASSWORD"
```
-> If everything works till here your database is running 
- 1. Verify Database and User Creation:
```sql
# SHOW DATABASES;
```
-> Make sure your database (your_database_name) is listed. 
-> Should look like:
```sql
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- 2. Check if your user is created with the right permissions:
```sql
# SELECT host, user FROM mysql.user;
```
-> This should list your USER.
-> Should look like:
```sql
mysql> SELECT host, user FROM mysql.user;
+-----------+-------------+
| Host      | User        |
+-----------+-------------+
| %         | bob         |
| %         | root        |
| 127.0.0.1 | healthcheck |
| ::1       | healthcheck |
| localhost | healthcheck |
| localhost | mariadb.sys |
| localhost | root        |
+-----------+-------------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- 3. To confirm the user's permissions:
```sql
# SHOW GRANTS FOR '<USER>'@'%';
```
If the USER does not have the correct permissions:
-> Should look like:
```sql
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'bob'@'%';
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for bob@%                                                                                   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `bob`@`%` IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '*61584B76F6ECE8FB9A328E7CF198094B2FAC55C7' |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
- 4. Correct Any Issues with User Permissions
```sql
# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `<your_database_name>`.* TO '<USER>'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<your_password>';
# FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
-> Should look like:
```sql
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `mariadb`.* TO 'bob'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'bob';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

- 5. Retry Connecting from the Host
Exit from the container and try connecting again from your host:

```
(Remove mariadb volume):
```bash
docker volume rm mariadb
```

### --------------------------------------------
### PROBLEMS? ----------------------------------

IF ANY OF THE PRIVOUS COMMAND AREN'T WORKING
LOOK HERE:

1) PROBLEM AT `docker-compose up -d`
Similar output:
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d`

[+] Running 0/0
 ⠋ Container mariadb  Starting        0.1s 
Error response from daemon: error while mounting volume '/var/lib/docker/volumes/mariadb/_data': failed to mount local volume: mount /home/<username>/data/mysql:/var/lib/docker/volumes/mariadb/_data, flags: 0x1000: no such file or directory
```

- `Check the Directory Path` : Make sure that the directory /home/<username>/data/mysql exists on your host machine. You can check this using the terminal:
```bash
ls /home/<username>/data/mysql
```
If it doesn’t exist, you'll need to create it.
```bash
mkdir -p /home/<username>/data/mysql
```
This command will create the directory along with any necessary parent directories.

- `Re-run Docker Compose` : After ensuring the directory exists and has the correct permissions, try running your Docker Compose command again:
```bash
docker volume rm mariadb
```
-> Be careful with this command as it will delete the volume and all data stored in it.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2) PROBLEM AT `docker-compose logs mariadb`
Similar output:
```bash
$ docker-compose logs mariadb

Great! It looks like you were able to successfully connect to the MariaDB server as the root user. 
Now, let’s verify that the user and database were created as expected and troubleshoot the access issue with your application user.

Now that you’re inside the MariaDB shell, run the following commands to check if your intended database and user exist.
- Check Databases:
```sql
# SHOW DATABASES;
```
-> Look for the database name you specified in your WP_DATABASE_NAME variable.

- Check Users:
Check if the user you created exists and their access privileges
```sql
# SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
```
-> Look for your specified DB_USER. It should show up with a % host entry, allowing access from any host.

- Grant Privileges to USER:
If USER should have access to the database but isn't seeing it, make sure to grant the necessary privileges:
```sql
# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `<your_database_name>`.* TO '<USER_NAME>'@'%';
# FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```




Question about the script.sh. 
why did you remove:
#     # Create a new database if specified

I removed the sections in your script related to creating a new database and user because you mentioned that the main issue was with getting MariaDB up and running in the container. When MariaDB is started with --skip-grant-tables and --skip-networking, it allows you to bypass some common authentication mechanisms and makes it easier to manipulate database users, but that also means certain commands (like creating new users and granting privileges) might not be executed as expected when MariaDB is still in that state.

Here’s why I removed those sections:

Database and User Creation:

The initial script was likely stopping before the part where the database and users were created because --skip-grant-tables disables grants and privileges management until MariaDB is fully started. This could cause issues with user creation or setting up the database if you run those commands while the server is in that state.
If you're already creating the database and user inside Docker via environment variables or setup during the container build phase (or it's pre-configured), the script might not need to do that step again.
Container Setup:

The script was running MariaDB with --skip-grant-tables, meaning MariaDB was essentially in a "maintenance mode" where privileges were disabled. It's safe to set the root password, but trying to create a new database or user when you're still in this state might cause issues, especially if it’s already been set up in the Dockerfile or environment.
Once MariaDB is fully initialized and ready, you don’t need to create new users or databases unless it’s part of your setup routine for specific applications that expect certain databases/users to exist.
Stability:

After MariaDB is started and you set the root password, you can later safely switch back to normal mode, but running these commands immediately after starting with --skip-grant-tables could lead to an incomplete or misconfigured setup if the instance isn't yet fully initialized.
Suggested Fix:
If you want to retain the creation of a database and user, the better place to do that would be after the MariaDB server has been fully initialized and running (i.e., after mysqld has started in the foreground without --skip-grant-tables), and not before. This ensures you're interacting with a fully operational database that can properly execute those commands.

If your Docker setup or MariaDB initialization already takes care of database creation and user setup, you can skip those commands.

Final Script (with database and user creation):
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Create necessary directories and set permissions as root
mkdir -p /run/mysqld /var/log/mysql
chown -R mysql:mysql /run/mysqld /var/log/mysql

# Start mysqld with networking enabled
echo "Starting mysqld..."
mysqld --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking &
pid="$!"

# Wait for mysqld to be ready
echo "Waiting for mysqld to be ready..."
while ! mysqladmin ping --silent; do
    sleep 1
done
echo "MariaDB is ready."

# Secure MariaDB installation
mysql -u root <<EOF
-- Set the root password
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF

# Create a new database if specified
if [ -n "$WP_DATABASE_NAME" ]; then
    echo "Creating database: $WP_DATABASE_NAME"
    mysql -u root -p"${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}" -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS \`${WP_DATABASE_NAME}\` CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
fi

# Create a new user and grant privileges if specified
if [ -n "$DB_USER" ] && [ -n "$DB_USER_PASSWORD" ]; then
    echo "Creating user: $DB_USER with access to $WP_DATABASE_NAME"
    mysql -u root -p"${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}" <<EOF
    CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS '${DB_USER}'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '${DB_USER_PASSWORD}';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON \`${WP_DATABASE_NAME}\`.* TO '${DB_USER}'@'%';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF
fi

echo "Database initialization complete."

# Stop the temporary mysqld instance
echo "Stopping the temporary mysqld instance..."
kill "$pid"
wait "$pid"

# Keep MariaDB running in the foreground
echo "Starting MariaDB in the foreground..."
exec mysqld
Key Changes:
Moved the database and user creation after MariaDB has been secured with the root password.
You can create the database and user only after the MariaDB instance is fully initialized and running.
Summary:
Removing those parts temporarily helps ensure that MariaDB starts correctly.
Once the database is fully initialized and operational, you can safely create databases and users.
If your MariaDB container is pre-configured with the necessary databases and users, you can skip these parts entirely.

Your MariaDB container setup is mostly solid, but there are a few adjustments and checks to make sure everything runs smoothly.

1. Dockerfile Adjustments
The Dockerfile looks mostly correct, but here are some improvements:

Permissions: After copying files, ensure ownership and permissions are appropriate.
Configuration File Path: Confirm the db-config.cnf file is placed in the correct path (/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/ or /etc/mysql/conf.d/) for your MariaDB setup to load it automatically.
Here’s a refined version:

dockerfile
Copy code
# Use Debian as a base image (Debian 12)
FROM debian:bookworm

# Update & install packages
RUN apt-get update -y && \
    apt-get install -y mariadb-server

# Copy configuration and initialization script
COPY ./tools/db-script.sh /
COPY ./tools/db-config.cnf /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/

# Ensure permissions for the initialization script
RUN chmod +x /db-script.sh

# Expose the MariaDB port
EXPOSE 3306

# Run the MariaDB setup script and start the server in the foreground
CMD ["/db-script.sh"]
2. MariaDB Initialization Script (db-script.sh)
Your script handles initialization well, but here are a few potential improvements:

Root User Initialization: Since root access is required to create the database and users, make sure DB_ROOT_PASSWORD is set properly.
Database Creation: Add a command to create the database if it does not exist (e.g., CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ...).
Error Handling: Check if mysqld fails to start by adding a timeout or failure check in the script.
Below is a refined version of db-script.sh:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Prepare necessary directories
mkdir -p /run/mysqld /var/log/mysql
chown -R mysql:mysql /run/mysqld /var/log/mysql

# Check if the database directory exists
if [ ! -d "/var/lib/mysql/${WP_DATABASE_NAME}" ]; then
    echo "Initializing MariaDB database..."

    # Start mysqld in the background for initialization
    mysqld --skip-networking --socket=/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock &
    mysql_pid=$!

    # Wait for mysqld to be ready
    until mysqladmin ping --socket=/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock --silent; do
        echo "Waiting for MariaDB to be ready..."
        sleep 2
    done

    # Secure root user
    echo "Initializing root user..."
    mysql -u root --socket=/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock <<EOF
    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF

    # Create the database
    echo "Creating database: '${WP_DATABASE_NAME}'..."
    mysql -u root -p"${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}" --socket=/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock <<EOF
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS \`${WP_DATABASE_NAME}\` CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
EOF

    # Create a new user and grant privileges if specified
    if [ -n "$DB_USER" ] && [ -n "$DB_USER_PASSWORD" ]; then
        echo "Creating user: '${DB_USER}' with access to '${WP_DATABASE_NAME}'"
        mysql -u root -p"${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}" --socket=/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock <<EOF
        CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS '${DB_USER}'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '${DB_USER_PASSWORD}';
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON \`${WP_DATABASE_NAME}\`.* TO '${DB_USER}'@'%';
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF
    fi

    echo "MariaDB initialization complete."

    # Stop the background mysqld instance
    kill "$mysql_pid"
    wait "$mysql_pid"
else
    echo "MariaDB already initialized."
fi

# Start MariaDB in the foreground
echo "Starting MariaDB in the foreground..."
exec mysqld
3. MariaDB Configuration File (db-config.cnf)
Ensure the db-config.cnf file is appropriately set up to configure MariaDB as needed. A common configuration might look like this, depending on your needs:

ini
Copy code
[mysqld]
# Example of some MariaDB configuration
bind-address = 0.0.0.0                 # Allow connections from other containers
skip-networking = 0                    # Enable networking
character-set-server = utf8mb4
collation-server = utf8mb4_general_ci
4. Environment Variables
Double-check that all required environment variables are defined in the .env file:

DB_ROOT_PASSWORD
WP_DATABASE_NAME
DB_USER
DB_USER_PASSWORD
5. Testing and Debugging
To verify everything works correctly:

Build and Run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
Check Logs: Use docker-compose logs mariadb to see if there are any issues during startup.

MySQL Connectivity: From within the WordPress container, verify that you can connect to the MariaDB instance:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it wordpress_container_name mysql -u DB_USER -p -h mariadb

### --------------------------------------------

# NGINX

###  Docker ----------------------------
This Dockerfile sets up a Docker image with NGINX installed on a Debian Linux (Debian 12 "Bookworm") base image, along with a self-signed SSL certificate for TLS encryption. Let’s break it down line by line:

1. FROM debian:bookworm
Specifies the base image for the Docker container. Here, it uses the Debian 12 ("Bookworm") version as the OS. This means the container will have a minimal Debian Linux environment to start with.
2. RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install -y nginx openssl -y
apt-get update -y updates the package lists to ensure the latest versions are available.
apt-get upgrade -y upgrades any outdated packages on the base image.
apt-get install -y nginx openssl installs NGINX (the web server) and OpenSSL (for creating SSL/TLS certificates) in one command. The -y flag automatically confirms the installation, so it runs without manual intervention.
3. RUN openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout "/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key" -subj "/C=/ST=/L=/O=/CN=${DOMAIN_NAME}" -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
This command creates a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL for secure HTTPS connections.
-x509 specifies the certificate format (X.509 is the standard format for TLS certificates).
-nodes means no password protection on the private key, so NGINX can load it without user input.
-days 365 sets the certificate to be valid for 365 days.
-newkey rsa:2048 generates a new 2048-bit RSA key pair.
-keyout specifies where to save the private key.
-subj "/C=/ST=/L=/O=/CN=${DOMAIN_NAME}" generates a certificate with the subject fields, including the common name (CN) for the domain. The ${DOMAIN_NAME} variable is expected to be defined externally.
-out specifies where to save the public certificate.
4. COPY conf/default-nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/
Copies a custom NGINX configuration file (default-nginx.conf) from the Docker build context’s conf directory into the container at /etc/nginx/conf.d/. This configuration file customizes how NGINX will handle requests, routes, or server settings.
5. EXPOSE 443
Tells Docker to expose port 443 on the container for HTTPS traffic. However, this does not automatically publish the port to the host. You’ll need to publish this port explicitly when running the container (e.g., using -p 443:443).
6. CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
Sets the command to run when the container starts. nginx is started with the flag -g "daemon off;" to prevent it from running as a background process. This keeps the container running and allows Docker to monitor the main process.



The difference between -keyout /etc/nginx/key.pem and -keyout "/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key" lies in the file paths and naming conventions used to store the private key. Let's break down what each part means and how these paths affect where the key is stored.

1. File Path Differences
-keyout /etc/nginx/key.pem

This specifies that the private key will be stored in the /etc/nginx/ directory with the filename key.pem.
The /etc/nginx/ directory typically holds NGINX configuration files and custom assets specific to NGINX, such as certificates or custom server settings. While storing the private key here works, it may not follow typical conventions and could expose the key to other users if permissions aren’t carefully set.
The .pem file extension is often used to denote cryptographic files that store keys or certificates in "Privacy-Enhanced Mail" (PEM) format, which is widely used for SSL certificates.
-keyout "/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key"

This path places the private key in /etc/ssl/private/, which is a standard location in Linux for storing private keys, with the filename nginx-selfsigned.key.
The /etc/ssl/ directory is typically used to store SSL certificates and private keys in subdirectories:
/etc/ssl/private/ is intended for private keys.
/etc/ssl/certs/ is generally used for public certificates.
This directory typically has restricted access for security, making it a more secure choice for storing private keys.
2. Security and Convention
Using /etc/ssl/private/ is generally more secure and follows Linux conventions, as it restricts access by default. This can reduce the risk of unintended access to sensitive files. The /etc/nginx/ directory does not have the same restrictive permissions by default, so storing keys here could be less secure unless permissions are manually adjusted.

3. File Naming Conventions
The file name itself, key.pem vs. nginx-selfsigned.key, is more about clarity than functionality.

key.pem is a more generic name and may be less clear in its purpose if you manage multiple keys.
nginx-selfsigned.key specifies that it’s a self-signed certificate generated for NGINX, which can help avoid confusion if multiple keys are present.
Summary
/etc/nginx/key.pem: Stores the private key in the NGINX directory, but it’s less secure and unconventional for storing SSL keys.
/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key: Stores the key in a secure, standard location, making it more secure and in line with common Linux SSL configurations.
For production environments, it's recommended to use /etc/ssl/private/ for storing private keys due to security best practices.
### --------------------------------------------

### Config.conf --------------------------------

Your NGINX configuration file is mostly correct, but there are a few improvements and potential corrections you may want to consider, especially for security and compatibility. Let's go through each section with comments on adjustments.

1. listen Directive for SSL
nginx
Copy code
listen 443 ssl;
listen [::]:443 ssl;
These lines look good and will bind both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to port 443 for SSL.
2. server_name Directive
nginx
Copy code
server_name $DOMAIN_NAME www.$DOMAIN_NAME localhost;
This line sets the server name for your virtual host. Ensure that $DOMAIN_NAME is set correctly in the environment, or replace it with an actual domain name (e.g., example.com). Otherwise, NGINX might fail to parse the variable.
3. SSL Settings
nginx
Copy code
ssl on;
ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl on; is technically redundant and can be omitted. Including ssl in the listen directive (listen 443 ssl;) is sufficient to enable SSL.
Certificates: The paths are correct, assuming these files exist at the specified locations.
SSL Protocols: Specifying TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 is a good practice to support the most secure and compatible protocols. You may also want to add an ssl_ciphers directive to control which ciphers are allowed:
nginx
Copy code
ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
4. File Handling
nginx
Copy code
root /var/www/html;
index index.html index.php;
try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
These settings look fine:
root sets the document root for the server.
index specifies default files when a directory is requested.
try_files $uri $uri/ =404; tries to load the file directly or look for a directory with the requested name; if neither exists, it returns a 404 error.
5. PHP Location Block
nginx
Copy code
location ~ \.php$ {
    fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;
    fastcgi_index index.php;
    include fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
}
fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000; assumes that there’s a FastCGI server (e.g., PHP-FPM) available at wordpress:9000.
Make sure the hostname wordpress resolves within your Docker network or adjust this to 127.0.0.1:9000 if running PHP-FPM locally in the container.
SCRIPT_FILENAME and PATH_INFO parameters look good.
include fastcgi_params;: Ensure that fastcgi_params exists in your configuration files (usually in /etc/nginx/), as it includes essential FastCGI parameters.
Final Suggested Config File
Here’s the configuration with the improvements and comments integrated:

nginx
Copy code
server {
    listen                  443 ssl;
    listen                  [::]:443 ssl;
    server_name             $DOMAIN_NAME www.$DOMAIN_NAME localhost;

    # SSL
    ssl_certificate         /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key     /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
    ssl_protocols           TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers             HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # File Handling
    root                    /var/www/html;
    index                   index.html index.php;
    try_files               $uri $uri/ =404;

    # PHP Processing
    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass        wordpress:9000;  # Ensure the 'wordpress' hostname resolves correctly
        fastcgi_index       index.php;
        include             fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param       SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param       PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
    }
}
This should be a solid configuration for your NGINX setup. Just ensure that:

$DOMAIN_NAME is properly defined.
The paths to fastcgi_params and SSL certificates are accurate.
The fastcgi_pass setting is correct based on your network setup.






Your NGINX container setup is mostly well done, but there are a few small issues that might prevent it from working as expected.

1. Dockerfile Issues
Self-Signed SSL Certificate Creation
Environment Variables in openssl: The openssl command in your Dockerfile uses ${DOMAIN_NAME}, but this value won't be expanded directly in the RUN command because Docker's build process does not inherit environment variables from the .env file.
Solution: You can hard-code the domain name or pass it as a build argument. Alternatively, you could create the certificate in the CMD or ENTRYPOINT script after the container has access to environment variables.
EXPOSE Command
You expose only port 443, which is correct for HTTPS. However, ensure that your docker-compose.yml file explicitly maps 443:443 under the NGINX service so it’s accessible outside the container.
Redundant -y in apt-get Commands
Minor but noticeable, there’s a redundant -y in the apt-get install line. It’s already covered, so you can remove one of them for clarity.
2. Nginx Configuration File (default-nginx.conf) Issues
Your NGINX configuration file is generally correct, but there are a few specific areas to address:

server_name Directive
$DOMAIN_NAME in the configuration file won’t resolve directly unless you’re passing it correctly via environment variables. If ${DOMAIN_NAME} is supposed to be set by Docker, you’ll need to ensure the container has access to this environment variable.
ssl Directive
The line ssl on; is outdated. NGINX doesn’t require this setting if listen ... ssl; is used. You can remove ssl on; since it’s not needed and may cause errors with newer NGINX versions.
fastcgi_pass Configuration
fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000; looks correct as long as your WordPress container is actually named wordpress in docker-compose.yml.
Ensure that your fastcgi_params file, usually located at /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params, is present and configured correctly.
Minor Syntax Clean-Up
Here is a cleaned-up version of your NGINX configuration:

nginx
Copy code
server {
    listen                  443 ssl;
    listen                  [::]:443 ssl;
    server_name             ${DOMAIN_NAME} www.${DOMAIN_NAME} localhost;
    
    # SSL Configuration
    ssl_certificate         /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key     /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
    ssl_protocols           TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;

    # File Handling
    root                    /var/www/html;
    index                   index.html index.php;
    try_files               $uri $uri/ =404;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass        wordpress:9000;
        fastcgi_index       index.php;
        include             fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param       SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param       PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
    }
}
3. Ensuring Compatibility in docker-compose.yml
Ensure that in your docker-compose.yml file:

The environment variable DOMAIN_NAME is accessible in the NGINX container if needed.
The NGINX service maps port 443:443 explicitly.
4. Testing and Debugging
After making these adjustments:

Rebuild and Restart: Rebuild the container and check logs to confirm there are no SSL or configuration errors.

bash
Copy code
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
Access Logs: Check NGINX logs to troubleshoot any runtime issues.

bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs nginx
Verify NGINX Access: Access the HTTPS URL and confirm SSL is working correctly.








I found this example:
dockerfile:
"
FROM debian:buster
RUN apt -y update && apt install -y nginx && apt install openssl -y
COPY ./tools/script.sh /
CMD [ "/script.sh" ]
"

script.sh:

echo "
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    #server_name www.$DOMAIN_NAME $DOMAIN_NAME;
    ssl_certificate $CERTS_;

            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        }
} ' >>  /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
nginx -g "daemon off;"
"

config.conf:

            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        }
}
"

can you explain what is happening in the script.sh and if the echo is necessary?


ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let’s break down the script.sh and evaluate its components and necessity.

Breakdown of script.sh
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Generate a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key \
  -out $CERTS_ \
  -subj "/C=MO/L=KH/O=1337/OU=student/CN=sahafid.42.ma"

# Create a server block configuration for Nginx (part 1)
echo "
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    #server_name www.$DOMAIN_NAME $DOMAIN_NAME;
    ssl_certificate $CERTS_;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;" > /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

# Add additional configuration details (part 2)
echo '
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
    index index.php;
    root /var/www/html;
    location ~ [^/]\.php(/|$) { 
            try_files $uri =404;
            fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        }
} ' >>  /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

# Start Nginx in the foreground
nginx -g "daemon off;"
What It Does
Generate SSL Certificate with OpenSSL

bash
Copy code
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key \
    -out $CERTS_ \
    -subj "/C=MO/L=KH/O=1337/OU=student/CN=sahafid.42.ma"
Generates a self-signed SSL certificate for one year (-days 365).
Creates a private key (-keyout) and a certificate (-out).
-subj specifies the certificate details like country (C=MO), organization (O=1337), etc.
The $CERTS_ environment variable is used as the path to save the generated certificate.
Create the Nginx Configuration

Two echo commands are used to construct the /etc/nginx/sites-available/default file, which defines the server block for Nginx.

Part 1: Adds basic settings like listen directives and SSL certificate paths.

bash
Copy code
echo "
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    #server_name www.$DOMAIN_NAME $DOMAIN_NAME;
    ssl_certificate $CERTS_;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;" > /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
Part 2: Adds remaining server configurations for SSL protocols, PHP handling, and root directory.

bash
Copy code
echo '
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
    index index.php;
    root /var/www/html;
    location ~ [^/]\.php(/|$) { 
            try_files $uri =404;
            fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        }
} ' >>  /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
Why the split into two echo commands? This is likely for readability or organizational purposes, but it’s not strictly necessary. The entire configuration could be written in a single echo block or copied as a pre-created file instead.

Run Nginx

bash
Copy code
nginx -g "daemon off;"
Starts the Nginx process in the foreground (daemon off) to prevent the container from exiting.
Is the echo Necessary?
No, the echo commands are not strictly necessary.

Instead of dynamically generating the Nginx configuration file using echo, you could:

Include a static configuration file (e.g., default) in the COPY step of the Dockerfile.
Copy the file directly to the appropriate location during the Docker build process:
dockerfile
Copy code
COPY config.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
This approach simplifies script.sh and avoids runtime generation of the configuration file.
Why Use echo?
The use of echo provides flexibility, allowing:

Dynamic configuration based on environment variables ($CERTS_, $DOMAIN_NAME).
The script to adapt the configuration without modifying or including additional files.
Recommendations:
If configuration values like $CERTS_ or $DOMAIN_NAME change often, keep the echo logic.
If they are static, use pre-built configuration files for simplicity and better maintainability.
Let me know if you'd like a streamlined example or further clarification!






You said:
would my way work aswell, because I can't have the 'RUN openssl reg ...' in the dockerfile, because of '-subj "/C=/ST=/L=/O=/CN=${DOMAIN_NAME}"'. The '${DOMAIN_NAME}' is not possible.
So I did it like this:
Dockerfile:
"
# Use Debian as a base image (Debian 12)
FROM debian:bookworm
# Update & intstall your package manager
RUN apt-get update -y && \
    apt-get upgrade -y && \
    apt-get install -y nginx openssl -y

# Copy custom MariaDB configuration script from the 'tools' directory to the container’s root directory
COPY ./tools/nginx-config.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/

        fastcgi_param       PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
		
	}
}

"

Is this way correct and will it work?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, your approach is correct and should work, assuming everything is configured properly. By moving the OpenSSL certificate generation to script.sh and using environment variables (${DOMAIN_NAME}) at runtime, you achieve flexibility without breaking the Dockerfile's build process.

Here’s a detailed analysis of your setup:

Dockerfile
Your Dockerfile:

Installs the required packages (nginx and openssl) during the build process.
Copies the configuration and the script into the container.
Defers dynamic actions (like using ${DOMAIN_NAME}) to the runtime script, avoiding issues with unavailable variables during the build.
Strengths:

The Docker image build remains static and environment-agnostic, which is a best practice.
By deferring dynamic actions to the container's runtime (script.sh), the image can adapt to different environments.
Key Points:

Why RUN openssl fails: Environment variables like ${DOMAIN_NAME} are not resolved at build time because they are injected at runtime. Moving this to script.sh ensures the variables are available when the container runs.
The EXPOSE instruction is correct for making port 443 accessible.
script.sh
Your script.sh dynamically generates the SSL certificate using the runtime environment variable ${DOMAIN_NAME} and starts Nginx.

Breakdown:
bash
Copy code
openssl req \
    -x509 \
    -nodes \
    -days 365 \
    -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout "/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key" \
    -subj "/C=/ST=/L=/O=/CN=${DOMAIN_NAME}" \
    -out "/etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt"
Creates the self-signed SSL certificate with details populated from the ${DOMAIN_NAME} variable.
The /C=/ST=/L=/O=/CN=${DOMAIN_NAME} allows for flexibility in defining the certificate's common name (CN) dynamically.
bash
Copy code
nginx -g "daemon off;"
Starts Nginx in the foreground, keeping the container running.
config.conf
This file is a configuration for Nginx that defines the server behavior.

Key Features:
SSL Configuration:

Points to the dynamically generated certificate (/etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt) and private key (/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key).
Enables TLS 1.2 and 1.3.
Dynamic Domain Support:

nginx
Copy code
server_name $DOMAIN_NAME www.$DOMAIN_NAME localhost;
Allows the server_name directive to adapt based on the runtime environment variable ${DOMAIN_NAME}.
PHP Handling:

nginx
Copy code
location ~ \.php$ {
    fastcgi_pass WordPress:9000;
    ...
}
Configures Nginx to forward PHP requests to a FastCGI process running on the container WordPress at port 9000.
Root and Index Directives:

nginx
Copy code
root /var/www/html;
index index.html index.php;
Specifies the document root and default index files.
Will This Work?
Yes, your setup is well-structured and should work if:

Environment Variables:

Ensure ${DOMAIN_NAME} is properly set when running the container (e.g., via docker run -e DOMAIN_NAME=example.com).
Container Network:

Ensure Nginx can communicate with the PHP service (WordPress:9000) as specified in fastcgi_pass. This requires a properly configured Docker network if these are in separate containers.
Configuration File Location:

Ensure Nginx loads your custom configuration file (/etc/nginx/conf.d/nginx-config.conf). By default, Nginx includes configurations from /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf.
File Permissions:

Verify permissions for generated SSL certificates and configuration files.
Suggested Improvements:
Validate Environment Variable: Add a check in script.sh to ensure ${DOMAIN_NAME} is not empty:

bash
Copy code
if [ -z "${DOMAIN_NAME}" ]; then
    echo "DOMAIN_NAME is not set. Exiting."
    exit 1
fi
Default Configuration: Consider a fallback for server_name if ${DOMAIN_NAME} is missing:

nginx
Copy code
server_name $DOMAIN_NAME www.$DOMAIN_NAME localhost;
Simplify Dockerfile Comments: Remove commented-out code (RUN openssl ...) to avoid confusion.

Conclusion
Your approach is correct and follows best practices for dynamic configuration in Docker. The setup should work as expected, provided you address the runtime dependencies like environment variables and network connectivity. Let me know if you'd like further clarification or assistance with testing!





These warnings are caused by missing values for several subject attributes in the openssl req command used to generate the SSL certificate.

C= stands for Country Name.
ST= stands for State or Province.
L= stands for Locality (City).
O= stands for Organization.
Since you haven’t specified these fields, OpenSSL is skipping them. The command still generates the certificate, but these attributes are left empty.

This is usually not an issue if you're creating a self-signed certificate for local or testing purposes (like in your case with nginx), but for production, it’s a good practice to fill out those values to avoid warnings or errors from browsers when using the certificate.





4. Test the Server Configuration with NGINX:
You can also test the NGINX configuration for errors before trying to start the server by running this command inside the container:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it <nginx-container-name> nginx -t
If everything is configured correctly, you should see a message like:

vbnet
Copy code
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
If there are errors, NGINX will output them, and you can fix the issues based on the error messages.




docker network ls
docker network inspect bridge




SSL Certificate Creation Logs:

objectivec
Copy code
Create a self-signed SSL certificate...
.+...+.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*...........+...
This part is generated by the openssl req command, which is used to generate a self-signed SSL certificate. The characters you're seeing like +, *, and . represent the progress of the SSL certificate generation process, which is normal output for OpenSSL commands. These are just indicators of the internal progress, but they don't affect the result of the SSL certificate creation.



Accessing NGINX: Ensure that NGINX is running properly by accessing it through the browser at https://<your_domain_or_ip>. You should see your website served over HTTPS.
Certificate in Use: If you're using a self-signed certificate, browsers might show a warning saying the connection is not trusted. For a production environment, you'd want to use a certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA).

port forwarding for a Virtual Machine (VM) running on software like VirtualBox or VMware, where you want to make services (like NGINX) inside the VM accessible from your host machine or external network. Let me break it down and explain whether or not you need to perform this setup.
Do You Need Port Forwarding?
Step 1: Determine Your Virtualization Platform
The steps depend on whether you're using VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V, or another virtualization software.
For VirtualBox:
Open VirtualBox Manager.
Select your VM.
Click on Settings > Network:
Ensure the network adapter is set to NAT or Bridged Adapter.
If the adapter is NAT, click Advanced > Port Forwarding:
Add rules for ports 80 and 443:
Rule 1:
Name: HTTP
Protocol: TCP
Host Port: 80
Guest Port: 80
Rule 2:
Name: HTTPS
Protocol: TCP
Host Port: 443
Guest Port: 443
Click OK to save and restart your VM














Problem1:
path '/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key' has permission denied
and path '/etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt', has nginx-selfsigned.crt not such a file or directory. 

Could it be that they are installed somewhere else or that I need to set the permission or do I need to create folders?

It looks like you're running into permission and directory issues for the SSL certificate files (nginx-selfsigned.key and nginx-selfsigned.crt). Let's address both problems:
Problem 1: Permission Denied for /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key

This error indicates that NGINX does not have the necessary permissions to write to the /etc/ssl/private/ directory, or it doesn’t exist. You need to ensure the directory is created and has the correct permissions for NGINX to write the key.
Problem 2: File or Directory Not Found for /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt

This error indicates that either the /etc/ssl/certs/ directory does not exist, or the file was not created successfully during the script execution.
Steps to Resolve These Issues:
1. Ensure Directories Exist

You need to create the necessary directories for storing the SSL certificate files. You can add these commands in your nginx-script.sh to ensure that the directories exist before attempting to write the files:

Modify your nginx-script.sh to include the following directory creation steps:

#!/bin/bash

# Ensure ${DOMAIN_NAME} is not empty.
if [ -z "${DOMAIN_NAME}" ]; then
    echo "DOMAIN_NAME is not set. Exiting."
    exit 1
fi

# Ensure the necessary directories exist
mkdir -p /etc/ssl/private /etc/ssl/certs

# Create a self-signed SSL certificate for TLS (or use your own cert files)
echo "Creating a self-signed SSL certificate..."
openssl req \
    -x509 \
    -nodes \
    -days 365 \
    -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout "/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key" \
    -subj "/C=NL/ST=Holland/L=Amsterdam/O=Codam/CN=${DOMAIN_NAME}" \
    -out "/etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt"

# Check if the certificate files were created successfully
if [ ! -f /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt ] || [ ! -f /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key ]; then
    echo "Error: SSL certificate creation failed. Exiting."
    exit 1
else
    echo "SSL certificate creation successful."
fi

# Start NGINX in the foreground
echo "Starting nginx..."
nginx -g "daemon off;"

Explanation:

    mkdir -p /etc/ssl/private /etc/ssl/certs: This ensures that the directories /etc/ssl/private/ and /etc/ssl/certs/ exist. The -p flag will not give an error if the directories already exist.
    After ensuring the directories exist, the script proceeds to generate the SSL certificates.

2. Set Correct Permissions

The permission issue for /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key usually happens because the directory and/or files may not have the correct ownership or read/write permissions for the NGINX process (which often runs as www-data or nginx user). You can modify the script to set the correct permissions after creating the certificate files:

Modify your nginx-script.sh to set the correct file permissions:

#!/bin/bash

# Ensure ${DOMAIN_NAME} is not empty.
if [ -z "${DOMAIN_NAME}" ]; then
    echo "DOMAIN_NAME is not set. Exiting."
    exit 1
fi

# Ensure the necessary directories exist
mkdir -p /etc/ssl/private /etc/ssl/certs

# Create a self-signed SSL certificate for TLS (or use your own cert files)
echo "Creating a self-signed SSL certificate..."
openssl req \
    -x509 \
    -nodes \
    -days 365 \
    -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout "/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key" \
    -subj "/C=NL/ST=Holland/L=Amsterdam/O=Codam/CN=${DOMAIN_NAME}" \
    -out "/etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt"

# Check if the certificate files were created successfully
if [ ! -f /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt ] || [ ! -f /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key ]; then
    echo "Error: SSL certificate creation failed. Exiting."
    exit 1
else
    echo "SSL certificate creation successful."
fi

# Set correct permissions for the certificate files
chmod 600 /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key
chmod 644 /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
chown root:root /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key
chown root:root /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt

# Start NGINX in the foreground
echo "Starting nginx..."
nginx -g "daemon off;"

Explanation:

    chmod 600 /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key: This command ensures that the private key file has read and write permissions only for the owner (root).
    chmod 644 /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt: This command ensures that the certificate file is readable by everyone, but only writable by the owner (root).
    chown root:root /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key and chown root:root /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt: This ensures the certificate files are owned by root, which is usually the appropriate user for NGINX to have access to these files.

3. Check If Files Exist After Running the Script

If the certificate files are still not being created, you can check manually whether the directories /etc/ssl/private/ and /etc/ssl/certs/ are created and the certificates are present:

docker exec -it <nginx-container-name> ls /etc/ssl/private
docker exec -it <nginx-container-name> ls /etc/ssl/certs

If the files are not found, it indicates that the script is not executing properly or that the directories are not created.
4. Ensure NGINX Can Read the Files

Finally, make sure that your NGINX configuration file is pointing to the correct paths for the certificate files, and that they are correctly mounted in the container (if using volumes).

For example, in the Docker Compose file (if you're using one), ensure the SSL certificates are correctly mapped:

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      - ./ssl:/etc/ssl  # This maps the host ssl directory to the container

Alternatively, you can mount the specific certificate files from your host machine if you are not generating them dynamically inside the container.
Conclusion:

    Ensure the directories /etc/ssl/private/ and /etc/ssl/certs/ exist in your container and create them if they do not.
    Set the appropriate file permissions on the certificate files after they are created.
    Check if the files are being created successfully and ensure NGINX has access to them.
    Consider checking your Docker Compose or volume mounts to verify correct file paths.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve both the permission and missing file issues.

The line you're referring to:

# Replace domain in nginx config using envsubst
echo "Substituting DOMAIN_NAME in NGINX configuration..."
envsubst '${DOMAIN_NAME}' < /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf.template > /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

is part of a process to dynamically replace the ${DOMAIN_NAME} placeholder in your NGINX configuration file with the actual value of the DOMAIN_NAME environment variable. Let me explain why this step is needed and how it works.
What is envsubst and Why is It Needed?

    envsubst: This is a command-line utility that reads environment variables in a shell script or command and substitutes them into a file or string. It’s part of the GNU gettext suite of tools.

    Purpose: In your case, you have a variable ($DOMAIN_NAME) in your NGINX configuration (default.conf.template), but Docker doesn’t automatically substitute environment variables directly into your configuration files.

Thus, you need a way to replace the ${DOMAIN_NAME} placeholder with the actual domain name (the value of the DOMAIN_NAME environment variable) before starting NGINX.
Example:

Assume the following:

    You have an NGINX configuration file (default.conf.template) that contains a placeholder like this:

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name ${DOMAIN_NAME} www.${DOMAIN_NAME};
    ...
}

You have an environment variable DOMAIN_NAME set in your container, for example:

export DOMAIN_NAME="example.com"

The line you mentioned runs the envsubst command to replace ${DOMAIN_NAME} with the actual value of example.com.

    envsubst '${DOMAIN_NAME}' < /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf.template: This reads the default.conf.template file.
    > /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf: This writes the modified content to a new file (default.conf) with the domain name substituted in place of ${DOMAIN_NAME}.

After running the envsubst command, the resulting default.conf will look like this:

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name example.com www.example.com;
        ...
    }

Why is This Necessary?

    Docker and Environment Variables: Docker doesn’t automatically substitute environment variables in files (e.g., nginx.conf or default.conf). It only uses environment variables in the shell environment or commands executed inside the container.

    Template Configuration: By using envsubst, you can have a template configuration file (default.conf.template) that contains placeholders for dynamic values like the domain name, which will be replaced at runtime when the container starts. This allows you to deploy the same container with different configurations based on the environment.

What Happens If You Skip This Step?

If you don’t use envsubst:

    The $DOMAIN_NAME in your NGINX configuration file will be treated as a literal string rather than the environment variable’s value.
    The NGINX server will not recognize the $DOMAIN_NAME as a valid domain and may not work as expected (i.e., it might not serve content properly because it doesn't match the actual domain).

Alternatives to envsubst:

If you prefer not to use envsubst, here are a couple of alternatives:

    Manually replace the domain in the NGINX config file before the container starts. This is more static, but less flexible.

    Use a Docker templating tool like dockerize, which can perform the substitution at runtime.

Summary:

    The envsubst command is used to substitute the value of an environment variable (in this case, DOMAIN_NAME) into a configuration file (default.conf.template) to dynamically configure NGINX based on the environment.
    It’s necessary because Docker doesn’t automatically replace environment variables inside configuration files.
    Without it, NGINX will not use the correct domain name, and your configuration might not work as expected.

I tried this step '5. Test NGINX with HTTP (Temporarily Disable SSL)'
I tried running this command 'curl -k https://jmetzger.42.fr', but I only got this output:
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: jmetzger.42.fr

Does that mean something is wrong with nginx? 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

The error message curl: (6) Could not resolve host: jmetzger.42.fr indicates that DNS resolution is failing — meaning the domain name jmetzger.42.fr is not being resolved to an IP address. This is generally a network or DNS issue, rather than an issue with NGINX specifically. Let’s break it down and troubleshoot:
What Could Be Happening?

    DNS Resolution Issue:
        Your system is unable to resolve the domain name jmetzger.42.fr into an IP address.
        This could happen for a number of reasons, including misconfiguration of DNS settings or if the domain name hasn't been properly registered or linked to an IP address yet.

    NGINX Configuration Issue (unlikely based on this error):
        NGINX wouldn’t cause a DNS resolution failure. NGINX can only work with the IP address or hostname that it is given once DNS resolution is completed. If the DNS resolution fails, NGINX won’t even get a chance to respond.

Steps to Diagnose and Fix:

    Check DNS Resolution from Your Local Machine:

        Try to resolve the domain name manually using the dig or nslookup commands:

dig jmetzger.42.fr
# or
nslookup jmetzger.42.fr

If these commands don’t return an IP address, it means the domain is not resolving correctly, and the issue is likely with DNS configuration or propagation.

If the domain resolves correctly, you’ll see something like this:

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    jmetzger.42.fr.   3600    IN      A       192.0.2.123

Check DNS Settings:

    If the domain doesn't resolve, check your DNS settings. Make sure the domain jmetzger.42.fr has been registered and has the correct DNS records (especially the A record pointing to the correct server’s IP address).
    If you're using a custom DNS server, ensure it's working properly. If you don’t have control over the DNS (e.g., if it's managed by a third-party provider), you might need to verify the DNS records on their platform.

Try Using an IP Address Instead of Domain:

    If you know the server’s IP address where NGINX is running, try accessing it using the IP instead of the domain name:

    curl -k https://<server-ip>

    If this works, it further confirms that the issue is related to DNS resolution, not NGINX itself.

Check Docker Network Configuration:

    If you are running NGINX inside a Docker container, ensure that it is correctly connected to the Docker network and that other containers (e.g., the WordPress container) can communicate with each other.

    If you're accessing it via jmetzger.42.fr locally and it's supposed to be a local or development environment, make sure that the domain is properly mapped to the IP address of the NGINX container in your /etc/hosts file or via a local DNS setup (e.g., using a reverse proxy).

DNS Propagation Delay (if new domain):

    If you just registered or changed DNS settings for jmetzger.42.fr, it may take some time (typically up to 48 hours) for DNS changes to propagate globally. You can check the status of DNS propagation via online tools like DNS Checker.

Check Firewall and Ports:

    Make sure that the server where your NGINX is running is not blocking incoming traffic on port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP). This is especially relevant if you're trying to access your NGINX server externally.

NGINX Logs:

    Check your NGINX logs to see if there are any issues with how NGINX is handling requests:

        docker exec -it <nginx-container-name> tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

        This can give you more insight if NGINX is seeing incoming requests and if it’s handling them correctly.

Summary:

    The error Could not resolve host is related to DNS resolution, not necessarily an issue with NGINX.
    Check the DNS settings for jmetzger.42.fr and ensure the domain resolves correctly.
    Test with an IP address instead of the domain name to confirm that the server and NGINX are functioning correctly.
    If the domain is newly registered or DNS settings were just updated, consider the possibility of DNS propagation delay.

Once the DNS resolution issue is fixed, NGINX should be able to respond properly to requests.

The 502 Bad Gateway error means that your NGINX server is unable to communicate properly with the upstream service, which in your case seems to be WordPress (running inside a Docker container or elsewhere). It indicates that NGINX is acting as a reverse proxy and is trying to forward requests to another server (like PHP or WordPress), but it can't connect successfully.
Common Causes for 502 Bad Gateway:

    PHP-FPM/WordPress Service is Down:
        If your NGINX configuration is trying to pass requests to PHP (through fastcgi_pass), but the PHP-FPM service (WordPress) is not running, you’ll get a 502 error.

    Incorrect FastCGI Configuration:
        If the fastcgi_pass in your NGINX configuration is pointing to the wrong address or port (e.g., the wrong IP address or container name for the WordPress service), NGINX will not be able to connect to the WordPress PHP service, resulting in a 502 error.

    Docker Networking Issues:
        If you're using Docker, the issue might be related to how the containers are networked. For instance, the NGINX container might not be able to communicate with the WordPress container if they're not connected to the same Docker network or if the service name used in fastcgi_pass is incorrect.

Troubleshooting Steps:

    Check WordPress/ PHP-FPM Container:
        Ensure that the WordPress container (or whatever service you're using for PHP-FPM) is running and healthy. You can check this with:

docker ps

Look for the container name or ID of the WordPress/PHP-FPM container. If it's not running, start it with:

    docker start <container-name>

Verify Container Networking:

    If you're using Docker Compose or standalone Docker containers, make sure that both the NGINX container and the WordPress container are on the same network. You can inspect the network configuration for the containers by running:

    docker network inspect <network-name>

    If you're using Docker Compose, ensure the containers are defined in the same docker-compose.yml file under the same networks section.

Check fastcgi_pass in NGINX Configuration:

    The NGINX configuration should be pointing to the correct location for PHP-FPM (the WordPress container). Check this line in your NGINX config:

    fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;

    Here, wordpress should be the name of your WordPress container, and 9000 should be the PHP-FPM port. If you're using Docker, wordpress should match the service name in your docker-compose.yml or the container name.

Check PHP-FPM Logs:

    Check the logs of your WordPress (PHP-FPM) container to see if there are any errors preventing it from starting or responding correctly. Run:

    docker logs <wordpress-container-name>

    If there are issues with PHP-FPM, they should show up here.

Check NGINX Logs:

    Check the NGINX logs for more detailed error information. This will help you understand why the connection to the upstream service (WordPress) is failing.
        The error log is typically located at /var/log/nginx/error.log (inside the NGINX container or the host machine). You can view it by running:

        docker logs <nginx-container-name>

Confirm Ports and Networking:

    If you're using port forwarding (like 80:80 or 443:443), make sure that those ports are forwarded correctly from the host to the container.
    Additionally, verify that NGINX is listening on the correct IP address and port. You can check this with:

    curl -I http://127.0.0.1

Test Connection Between Containers:

    To ensure the NGINX container can reach the WordPress container, execute a simple test from the NGINX container (using docker exec):

        docker exec -it <nginx-container-name> ping wordpress

        This will help ensure that the NGINX container can reach the WordPress container by its name (or service name if using Docker Compose).

Conclusion:

The 502 Bad Gateway error likely means that NGINX is not able to connect to your upstream PHP-FPM/WordPress service. The problem could be due to:

    The WordPress/PHP-FPM container not running.
    Incorrect network configuration (containers not being able to talk to each other).
    A misconfiguration in your NGINX settings (wrong fastcgi_pass or incorrect container name/port).

By following the steps above, you can pinpoint the issue and fix the connectivity between NGINX and WordPress.





















Step 1: Verify Docker Compose Network
If you're using Docker Compose, containers must share the same network for hostnames (like mariadb) to resolve correctly.

List running containers:

bash
Copy code
docker ps
Check the container names and ensure both WordPress and MariaDB are running.

Inspect Docker networks:

bash
Copy code
docker network ls
Look for the network your containers should be part of (e.g., default or a custom network).

Inspect the network details:

bash
Copy code
docker network inspect <network-name>
Confirm both wordpress and mariadb are connected to the same network.

Step 2: Test Hostname Resolution
From the WordPress container, check if mariadb resolves to an IP address:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it wordpress ping mariadb
Success: If you get responses, the containers are networked correctly.
Failure: The mariadb hostname is not resolving, likely due to:
Containers not on the same network.
Incorrect service name for MariaDB in WP_DATABASE_HOST.
Step 3: Manually Connect Using IP
If the hostname doesn’t resolve, try using MariaDB’s container IP address directly:

Get MariaDB’s IP address:

bash
Copy code
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' mariadb
Example output: 172.18.0.2

Test connection using the IP:

bash
Copy code
mysql -h "172.18.0.2" -u "${DB_USER}" -p
If this works, the issue is with hostname resolution.

Step 4: Check Service Name
If using Docker Compose, the hostname should match the service name defined for MariaDB in the docker-compose.yml file.

Example:

yaml
Copy code
services:
  wordpress:
    ...
    environment:
      WP_DATABASE_HOST: mariadb

  mariadb:
    ...
    container_name: mariadb
Ensure the environment variable WP_DATABASE_HOST in WordPress matches the service name mariadb.
Step 5: Test MariaDB from Its Container
To rule out issues with MariaDB itself:

Connect to the MariaDB container:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it mariadb bash
Log in to MySQL locally:

bash
Copy code
mysql -u"${DB_USER}" -p
Check if the database is accessible and verify that the user credentials are correct.

Step 6: Restart Services
Restart both containers to reset the network configuration:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
Step 7: Verify Firewall or Host Settings
If the containers are on the same network but still cannot communicate:

Check if Docker’s internal DNS resolver is working:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it wordpress cat /etc/resolv.conf
It should point to Docker’s DNS (e.g., 127.0.0.11).

Ensure no firewalls or external configurations are blocking communication.

Recap of Key Fixes
Ensure WP_DATABASE_HOST matches the MariaDB service name or IP address.
Verify both containers are on the same Docker network.
Use the correct credentials and test connectivity manually.
Restart the containers if necessary.
Let me know if you need further guidance!

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The absence of a database explicitly named mariadb in the SHOW DATABASES output is not an issue unless you expect such a database to exist for your setup. Let me clarify:

Explanation:
Default and User-Created Databases:

The SHOW DATABASES; command lists all databases currently accessible to the logged-in user.
By default, MariaDB does not create a database named mariadb. It typically includes:
information_schema: A system database for metadata.
User-created databases (e.g., WordPressDB in your case).
Your Database WordPressDB:

If WordPressDB is intended to be the database used by WordPress, this is correct and expected.
MariaDB itself does not have a "self-referencing" database; its functionality is tied to these databases and the system metadata.
Next Steps:
Verify Configuration Matches:

Ensure the DB_NAME in your .env file matches the WordPressDB you see listed here:
env
Copy code
WP_DATABASE_NAME=WordPressDB
Also ensure the environment variable WP_DATABASE_HOST points to this MariaDB server's hostname.
Verify WordPress Connection: If everything matches but WordPress is still having issues:

Confirm DB_USER and DB_USER_PASSWORD in your .env file match the credentials you're testing with mysql -ubob -p.
Test Connection from WordPress: From within the WordPress container:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it wordpress bash
mysql -h "mariadb" -u "bob" -p "WordPressDB"
If it connects successfully, WordPress should be able to interact with the database.

# Extra INFO

###  .conf and .cnf ----------------------------
difference between `.conf` and `.cnf`

Both `.conf` and `.cnf` are commonly used for configuration files, but they are often associated with different types of applications or services.
Key Differences: 
`.conf` is more general and used by many different types of software, associated with operating system services and various servers.
`.cnf` is more specialized, often used for MySQL and database-related configurations, associated with database configurations.

### --------------------------------------------
###  Docker version ----------------------------

The version field was used in older versions of Docker Compose (pre-1.27.0) to specify the format of the configuration file and indicate which features were available in the Docker Compose specification. 
However, from Docker Compose v1.27.0 onwards, the requirement for a version field has been deprecated.

Older Docker Compose files (versioned):
Here, '3.9' specifies the schema version of the Docker Compose file.
```yaml
version: "3.9"

services: 
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb
```

Newer Docker Compose (no version field): With newer versions of Docker Compose (v1.27.0 and beyond), the version field is no longer required. You can simply define the services without specifying a version:
```yaml
services: 
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb
```
