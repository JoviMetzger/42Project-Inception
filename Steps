# Inception
Inception
This project is designed to broaden your understanding of system administration by using Docker.
You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual
machine.

### Step by step -------------------------------
1) Read about (make sure you understand):
    - What is Docker?
    - What is Docker Compose?
    - What are Multi-container Applications?
    - What is a Docker Image?
    - What Are Volumes?
    - How Daemons Work?
2) Set up your Virtual Machine
    - Either with [Ubuntu]() or [POP!_OS]()
3) Connect your Virtual Machine and VS code
    - Create a shared folder, between your VM and host.
    - Work over your host terminal, because VM terminal sucks.
4) You then have to set up:
    - MariaDB
    - Wordpress
    - Nginx
    - Start with `Docker-compose`, then MariaDB, wordpress and then NGINX.
    • A Docker container that contains MariaDB only without nginx.
    • A Docker container that contains WordPress + php-fpm (it must be installed and configured) only without nginx.
    • A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.
    • A volume that contains your WordPress database.
    • A second volume that contains your WordPress website files.
    • A docker-network that establishes the connection between your containers.

### --------------------------------------------
### Step 4 Explain -----------------------------

You need to start with MariaDB, as it is the database backend for WordPress. 
Here’s the ideal sequence and why:

MariaDB:
WordPress relies on a database to store its data. The MariaDB container provides this, so it needs to be up and running first.
This ensures WordPress can connect to the database as soon as it starts.

WordPress:
Once MariaDB is up, start the WordPress container. During startup, WordPress will try to connect to the database, so having MariaDB ready beforehand is essential.
WordPress will connect to MariaDB using environment variables (like database host, username, and password) in your docker-compose.yml file or Docker run command.

Nginx:
Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and web server for WordPress.
It can only serve WordPress properly if the WordPress container is already up and running, so start Nginx last.

### --------------------------------------------
### Docker -------------------------------------

1. What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that helps developers easily create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable environments that package everything needed to run a piece of software—code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration—so it can run reliably on any system, regardless of the environment.

Here’s a simple breakdown:
Key Concepts in Docker:
- 1) Containers:
    - A container is like a small, lightweight virtual machine that runs an application and its dependencies.
    - It ensures that the application works the same in different environments (e.g., on your laptop, in the cloud, or on a server).
    - Unlike full virtual machines, containers share the host system’s OS kernel, making them faster and more efficient in terms of resource usage.
- 2) Images:
    - A Docker image is like a template or blueprint for creating containers. It contains everything needed to run an app, including the code, libraries, environment variables, and system tools.
    - Images are read-only, and when a container starts from an image, it adds a writable layer on top of the image where it can make changes.
- 3) Docker Daemon:
    - The Docker daemon (dockerd) is the background service that runs on your host machine and is responsible for managing Docker containers, images, volumes, and networks.
    - It listens for Docker commands and executes them (like pulling images, starting containers, or creating networks).
- 4) Dockerfile:
    - A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions to create a Docker image.
    - Think of it as a recipe: it specifies the base image (e.g., python:3.9), the app’s code, dependencies, and how to run the app.

Example of a simple Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install the dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Command to run the app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
- 5) Docker Hub:
    - Docker Hub is like GitHub for Docker images. It’s a public registry where you can find and share Docker images.
    - You can pull official images (like nginx, mysql, or python) or push your own custom images to Docker Hub.

Why Use Docker?
- 1) Portability:
    - Docker ensures that your app will run the same way on different machines or environments. Once it's packed in a container, you can move that container across systems (from your laptop to production servers) without worrying about compatibility issues.
- 2) Consistency:
    - Since all dependencies and environment configurations are included inside the container, there are no "it works on my machine" problems anymore. Containers behave the same no matter where they run.
- 3) Lightweight:
    - Containers use less overhead compared to virtual machines because they share the host system's kernel, making them faster to start and requiring fewer resources.
- 4) Isolation:
    - Containers are isolated from one another and the host system. This isolation helps to avoid conflicts (e.g., two applications needing different versions of the same dependency).
- 5) Scalability:
    - Docker makes it easy to scale applications by running multiple instances of containers. This is especially useful in cloud environments where you can spin up containers as needed.


In Docker: The RUN apt-get install command inside the Dockerfile runs as the root user by default, which is why it works without any additional permissions.
In a Running Container: When you're trying to manually install something by running apt-get in an already running container, you must ensure you're using the root user. If you're inside a running container and need to run a command with apt-get, you can switch to the root user.

### Docker-Compose -----------------------------

2. What is Docker Compose?
Docker Compose is a tool used to easily manage and run multi-container Docker applications.
- Imagine you have a project with multiple parts, like a web app, a database, and maybe a message broker. Instead of running each part manually, Docker Compose lets you define all of them in a single file (called docker-compose.yml) and start everything with one command.
So, Docker Compose simplifies running complex applications with multiple containers.

### --------------------------------------------


---


### Multi-container------------------------------

3. What are Multi-container Applications?
A multi-container application is an app that needs more than one Docker container to work.
- For example, let's say you have an e-commerce website. It might need:
    - A web server (like Nginx or Apache) to serve the website.
    - A database (like MySQL or MongoDB) to store user data.
    - A caching service (like Redis) to make things faster.
Each of these components runs in its own container, but they work together to make the entire app function. This setup is called a multi-container application.

### --------------------------------------------


---


### Docker Image--------------------------------
4. What is a Docker Image?
A Docker image is like a blueprint or template for creating a Docker container.
- It contains everything needed to run an application, such as the code, libraries, and dependencies.
- When you start a container, it's created from a Docker image. The image is read-only and acts as a recipe for how the container should be built.
Think of a Docker image like a snapshot of your app environment that can be used to create multiple identical containers whenever you need.

### --------------------------------------------


---


### Volumes-------------------------------------

5. What Are Volumes?
Docker volumes are used to persist data generated or used by Docker containers. Normally, when a container is stopped or removed, all the data inside it is lost. Volumes allow you to keep that data even after the container is deleted.

Here’s how volumes work:
- Volumes are stored on the host machine outside the container’s filesystem, usually in /var/lib/docker/volumes/.
- They allow data sharing between the host system and one or more containers.
- Volumes are independent of the container lifecycle, so data is safe even when the container is deleted or stopped.

Example Use Case:
Let’s say you’re running a database container like PostgreSQL. You don’t want to lose your data every time the container stops. By using a volume, you can store the database data on your host machine, so that if you recreate the container, your data will still be there.

How Volumes Are Defined in `docker-compose.yml`:
In the `docker-compose.yml` example I gave earlier, this section:
```yaml
volumes:
  db_data:
```
Defines a named volume called db_data. It is used by the PostgreSQL service to store its data:
```yaml
volumes:
  - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```
This means the database data is stored outside the container, and will be preserved even if the container is destroyed.

### --------------------------------------------


---


### Daemons ------------------------------------

6. How Daemons Work?
A daemon is a background process that runs without user interaction. In Docker, the Docker daemon is the main program that manages containers, images, networks, and volumes. It listens for commands (like docker run or docker-compose up) and handles tasks like building, running, or stopping containers.

Here’s how Docker daemons work:
- `Docker Daemon (dockerd)` : The Docker daemon runs as a background process on the host machine. It listens to Docker API requests (commands you give Docker) and manages containers and resources (e.g., networks, volumes).
- `Client interaction` : The Docker client (CLI) is what you interact with when you run Docker commands. It communicates with the Docker daemon, which actually performs the tasks.
- `Container management` : The daemon handles everything related to containers, including creating, running, stopping, or destroying them.

Example:
When you run docker run to start a container, the Docker daemon:
- Pulls the required image if it’s not available locally.
- Creates a container from the image.
- Allocates resources (CPU, memory, storage) to the container.
- Runs the container in the background or attached to your terminal.

Should You Use Daemons?
The term daemon in Docker specifically refers to the background Docker process (the dockerd process), but in general computing, daemons refer to any background service or process. Let's look at when using daemons (background processes) is a good idea and when it might not be:

Advantages of Using Daemons (Background Processes):
- Automatic Management: Daemons can run automatically without user intervention. This is useful for services that need to be running at all times, like web servers, database servers, or background workers.
- Resource Management: Since they run in the background, you can better manage resources (CPU, memory) and keep your terminal free for other tasks.
- Continuous Service Availability: Daemons are perfect for tasks that need to be always on (like Docker itself, which runs the Docker daemon in the background to manage containers).

Disadvantages (or Why Not to Use Daemons):
- Difficult to Debug: If a daemonized process crashes or stops working correctly, it might be harder to troubleshoot since it runs in the background.
- Harder to Monitor: You may not realize if a daemon is misbehaving or consuming too many resources since it's not visible in the foreground.
- Overhead for Simple Tasks: For lightweight tasks that don't need to always be running (like one-time scripts or short-term jobs), using a daemon might add unnecessary complexity.

When to Use Them:
- Good Idea: Use daemons when you need to keep a service running continuously (e.g., a web server, a message broker, or a database service).
- Not a Good Idea: Avoid daemons for quick, one-off jobs or scripts that don't need to stay alive after they finish running.
In Docker's case, the daemon is essential for the system to function. Without it, you wouldn't be able to run containers, manage images, or interact with any of Docker’s features. For other software, whether or not you should use a daemon depends on the use case.

### VM vs Docker -------------------------------
7. Extra: (Virtual Machine vs Docker)

Summary of Differences:

| Feature          | Virtual Machine (VM)                           | Docker (Container)                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Architecture**  | Full guest OS on top of host OS                | Shares host OS kernel, isolated by processes      |
| **Startup Speed** | Slow (minutes)                                 | Fast (seconds)                                   |
| **Resource Usage**| Heavy, each VM needs its own OS                | Lightweight, shares host OS                      |
| **Isolation**     | Full OS isolation (secure, but heavier)        | Process-level isolation, lighter but less isolated|
| **Portability**   | Less portable, larger images (full OS)         | Highly portable, smaller images                  |
| **Performance**   | Slower (due to full OS overhead)               | Faster (less overhead)                           |
| **Use Cases**     | Running multiple OSes, legacy apps, full OS isolation | Microservices, cloud apps, lightweight tasks  |
| **Size of Images**| Large (GBs)                                    | Small (MBs to GBs)                               |

In Summary:
- `Docker (containers)` is more lightweight, faster, and more efficient when running multiple applications on the same machine. It's great for modern app development, where speed, portability, and scalability are key.
- `Virtual machines (VM)` offer more complete isolation and are better suited when you need to run different operating systems or when full OS separation is required.

### .ENV ---------------------------------------

# .env
General
DOMAIN_NAME=jmetzger.42.fr:
This specifies the domain name for the WordPress site. In this case, it seems to be a subdomain (jmetzger) of 42.fr, possibly referring to a user or server identifier.

DB_HOSTNAME=mariadb:
This is the hostname or IP address of the database server (MariaDB in this case). The value mariadb indicates that it expects the database service to be running on the same server or a server accessible by that name (e.g., within a Docker container network).

DB_DATABASE=wordpress:
This sets the name of the MySQL database that will be used for WordPress. The database is named wordpress.

MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root:
The password for the MySQL root user (the administrative user). Here, it’s set to root (which is a poor security practice, but it might be placeholder text for setup purposes).

Database Administrator
MYSQL_USER=bob:
This creates a MySQL user named bob, which will be the non-root user for interacting with the WordPress database.

MYSQL_PASSWORD=bob:
The password for the bob MySQL user is set to bob.

WordPress Admin (WordPress Backend)
WP_ADMIN=wordpress:
This sets the WordPress admin username to wordpress, which is used to log in to the WordPress dashboard.

WP_ADMIN_PWD=wordpress:
This sets the WordPress admin password to wordpress.

WP_ADMIN_EMAIL=wordpress@gmail.com:
This specifies the email address associated with the WordPress admin account. Here, it's set to wordpress@gmail.com, but this would typically be changed to a real email address during setup.

WordPress User (Frontend User Account)
WP_USR=wp_user:
This is the name of a regular user for the WordPress site, named wp_user. This could be a default user account created during setup.

WP_USER_PWD=wp_user:
The password for the wp_user is set to wp_user.

WP_USRR_EMAIL=user_wordpress@gmail.com:
The email address associated with the regular wp_user account is user_wordpress@gmail.com.

Summary
This configuration defines several key settings for deploying a WordPress instance:

Database connection details (hostname, database name, credentials)
WordPress admin credentials (for managing the site)
A regular user account (presumably for testing the site as a normal user)
Keep in mind, the actual passwords (root, bob, wordpress, etc.) should be changed to something more secure in a real deployment. The file likely serves as part of an environment setup for a WordPress installation, where these variables are injected into scripts or Docker containers to automate the deployment.
Since your MYSQL_USER environment variable is empty when you check it with echo $MYSQL_USER, it indicates that your .env file is not being loaded properly or the variables are not being passed to the Docker container correctly. Here’s how to troubleshoot and fix the issue.

Steps to Resolve the Issue
Check .env File Location:

Ensure your .env file is in the same directory where you run the docker-compose command. Docker Compose looks for the .env file in the project directory by default.
Verify .env Syntax:

Make sure there are no syntax errors in your .env file. For example:
Ensure there are no spaces around the = sign.
Each variable should be on a new line.
Your .env file should look like this:

plaintext
Copy code
# GENERAL
DOMAIN_NAME=jmetzger.42.fr              # Intra user name

# MARIADB DATABASE
DB_DATABASE=maria_database              # Name of the MySQL database that will be used for WordPress
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root                   # Password your choice 
MYSQL_USER=bob                             # User your choice
MYSQL_PASSWORD=bob                         # Password your choice  

# WORDPRESS ADMIN
WP_ADMIN=wordpress                      # User your choice
WP_ADMIN_PWD=wordpress                  # Password your choice 
WP_ADMIN_EMAIL=wordpress@gmail.com      # Email your choice

# WORDPRESS USER
WP_USR=wp_user                          # User your choice
WP_USER_PWD=wp_user                     # Password your choice 
WP_USRR_EMAIL=user_wordpress@gmail.com  # Email your choice

### Makefile -----------------------------------

# makefile
```
all:
	@docker-compose -f $(COMPOSE_FILE) up -d --build
```
Purpose: The all target builds and starts the Docker containers.
- `up:` This command starts (or creates, if not already created) the Docker services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
- `-d:` Runs the containers in detached mode, which means the containers will run in the background, and the terminal won't be blocked.
- `--build:` This flag forces the rebuilding of images before starting the services. If there are changes in your Dockerfile or project, they will be included.

```
down:
	@docker-compose -f $(COMPOSE_FILE) down
```
Purpose: The down target stops and removes the running Docker containers, along with any associated networks and temporary resources.
- `down:` This stops the containers and removes all related resources, including networks, volumes (unless explicitly persisted), and containers defined by the docker-compose.yml file.

```
clean: down
	docker system prune -af
	docker volume prune -f
```
Purpose: The clean target stops and removes all Docker containers and associated resources, and then aggressively cleans up unused Docker resources (like unused images, stopped containers, and volumes).
- `docker system prune -af:` This command removes all unused Docker objects (such as dangling images, stopped containers, and unused networks). The -a flag ensures that all unused images (not just dangling ones) are removed, and the -f flag forces it without asking for confirmation.
- `docker volume prune -f:` This removes all unused Docker volumes. The -f flag forces it without a prompt.

Both makefiles work:
option1
```Makefile
# Paths
COMPOSE_FILE	=	./scrs/docker-compose.yml

# --- Targets ---
# Builds and starts the Docker services
all:
	@docker-compose -f $(COMPOSE_FILE) up -d --build

# Stops and removes the containers, networks, and any temporary resources created
down:
	@docker-compose -f $(COMPOSE_FILE) down

# Rebuild and restart of the services
re: down all

# Cleans up Docker resources
clean: down
	docker system prune -af
	docker volume prune -f

.PHONY: all down re clean
```

option2
```
# Executable

# Stops and removes the containers, networks, and any temporary resources created
down:
	@docker-compose -f $(COMPOSE_FILE) down

# Rebuild and restart of the services
re: down all

# Cleans up Docker resources
clean: down
	@docker system prune -af
	@docker volume prune -f

.PHONY: all down re clean
```

### Docker-compose.yml -------------------------

# docker-compse.yml

1. General Overview
This Docker Compose file defines a multi-container application that consists of three main services:

MariaDB: The database service.
Nginx: The web server that will serve the website.
WordPress: The WordPress application itself.
The volumes and networks help manage data persistence and network communication between these services.

2. Detailed Explanation of Volumes
Volumes and Their Purpose:
Why volumes?
Docker containers are designed to be ephemeral (short-lived), meaning that any data generated within the container during runtime will be lost once the container is stopped or removed. Volumes are used to persist important data outside of the container, ensuring that it survives container reboots or even complete removals.

Why use bind mounts?
Bind mounts allow you to map a specific directory on the host machine to a directory in the container. This is especially useful for persistent data storage, like the MySQL database and WordPress content (uploads, themes, plugins). In your case:

MariaDB: Needs to persist its database data.
WordPress: Needs to persist website content, like uploads, themes, and plugins.

      device: /home/jmetzger/data/html      # This is the host directory where WordPress files (themes, plugins, uploads) will be stored
```
3. Why Each Part is Necessary
MariaDB Volume (mariadb:/var/lib/mysql):

Reason: MariaDB stores the actual database files in /var/lib/mysql within the container. By binding this to a host directory, you ensure that your databases are persistent across container restarts. Without this, any database data would be lost when the container stops.
WordPress Volume (wordpress:/var/www/html):

Reason: WordPress stores files such as themes, plugins, and uploads in /var/www/html. By binding this directory to the host, your WordPress website's content persists even when the container is restarted or removed.
Nginx Volume (nginx:/var/www/html):

Optional Use Case: If you need to store static files, custom configurations, or logs, you can bind mount a directory for Nginx. Since you're using WordPress and Nginx is just serving it, this may not be necessary unless you're doing something like custom Nginx configurations.
Conclusion
Volumes ensure that critical data (like the MariaDB database and WordPress content) persists across container restarts.
Networks allow your containers to communicate with each other internally on a dedicated Docker network.
Service Definitions detail how each container should be built, managed, and restarted.
This setup provides a robust architecture for running a WordPress site backed by MariaDB with Nginx acting as a reverse proxy, ensuring data persistence and internal communication.

what are these?
version: "3.8"

services:
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In a Docker Compose file, the version and services keys are essential components that define the structure of your multi-container Docker application. Here's a detailed explanation of what they are:

1. version
The version key specifies the version of the Compose file format you're using. This is important because different versions support different features. In your case, you've specified version: "3.8", which is part of the Docker Compose version 3 family.

Why version matters:
It determines what features and syntax are available in your Compose file.
Docker Compose version 3.x is widely used for modern applications, especially for deploying in production environments, and is compatible with Docker Swarm.
Version 3.8 specifically adds support for newer features and configurations, but still maintains backward compatibility with previous 3.x versions.
2. services
The services key defines all the individual services (containers) that make up your application. Each service runs in its own container and represents a specific part of your application.

Each service corresponds to a container.
In your example, under services, you define three services: mariadb, nginx, and wordpress. Each one represents a different container that is built and managed by Docker Compose.
Breakdown of services
mariadb:

This service defines a MariaDB container (the database).
It will be used to store and serve data for your WordPress application.
nginx:

This service defines an Nginx container (the web server).
Nginx acts as a reverse proxy that handles web traffic and directs it to the WordPress service.
wordpress:

This service defines a WordPress container (the application).
It will run the actual WordPress site, and it depends on the MariaDB database for data storage.
Example Structure:
```yaml
version: "3.8"           # Defines the version of the Docker Compose file format being used

services:                 # Defines the application services (containers) 
  mariadb:                # This is the MariaDB service (container)
    ...

  nginx:                  # This is the Nginx service (container)
    ...

  wordpress:              # This is the WordPress service (container)
    ...
```
Each of the services under services: will have its own specific configuration, such as:

Images (what Docker image to use)
Volumes (how to persist data)
Ports (what ports to expose)
Networks (how the service connects to other services)
In summary:

version: Specifies the Docker Compose file format.
services: Defines the different parts (containers) of your application that will work together to create a multi-container environment.
These two keys are critical in setting up a Docker Compose environment that ties together multiple containers into a functioning application.

1. What is the networks section?
The networks section in a Docker Compose file defines the networking configuration for your containers. Docker uses networks to allow containers to communicate with each other. Containers that are connected to the same network can talk to each other directly, using their container names as hostnames.

In Docker Compose, you can define custom networks so that specific services can communicate privately and securely.
By default, Docker Compose creates a network for you, but it's a good practice to define your own networks for better control, especially in more complex applications.
2. What is the inception network in your example?
The inception network is a custom network that you’ve defined in your Docker Compose file. All the services (containers) in your file — mariadb, nginx, and wordpress — are connected to this network, which allows them to communicate with each other.

yaml
Copy code
networks:              # Define custom networks for the services
  inception:           # Custom network named "inception"
    name: inception    # The actual network name is "inception"
inception: This is the name of the network within the Compose file. It's just an identifier.
name: inception: This specifies the actual name of the network that Docker will create. In this case, the name is "inception."
When Docker Compose runs, it creates this network and attaches the containers that use it to the network. This way, the mariadb, nginx, and wordpress containers can communicate because they are all attached to the same network.

3. Why do you need a custom network?
Internal Communication: All services in your Compose file (mariadb, nginx, and wordpress) are connected to the inception network. This allows the services to communicate internally using container names as hostnames (e.g., the WordPress service can talk to MariaDB by using mariadb as the hostname).

Isolation and Security: Custom networks ensure that services are isolated from other containers running outside of this Compose setup. Other Docker containers that are not on the inception network cannot communicate with the services defined here.

Easy Service Discovery: Docker automatically provides service discovery on custom networks. For example, in your WordPress container, if you set DB_HOSTNAME: mariadb, Docker will know to resolve mariadb to the correct container's IP address because both services are on the same inception network.

4. How is it used in your services?
In each service (MariaDB, Nginx, WordPress), the networks section specifies that the container should be connected to the inception network:

yaml
Copy code
services:
  mariadb:
    ...
    networks:
      - inception        # Connect MariaDB to the "inception" network

  nginx:
    ...
    networks:
      - inception        # Connect Nginx to the "inception" network

  wordpress:
    ...
    networks:
      - inception        # Connect WordPress to the "inception" network
This ensures that:

MariaDB, WordPress, and Nginx can communicate with each other internally on the inception network.
The services are isolated from other Docker containers not connected to the same network.
5. When would you use multiple networks?
In more complex applications, you might want to define multiple networks to control how different services interact. For example:

Frontend and Backend Networks: You could have an internal network for sensitive services (like databases) and an external network for web-facing services. This would prevent unnecessary exposure of your database to the internet-facing containers.
In your case, using a single custom network, inception, simplifies communication between all services while keeping them isolated from other Docker containers running on your system.

Summary
networks: Defines the network(s) that services can use to communicate.
Custom Network (inception): Allows your services (MariaDB, Nginx, WordPress) to communicate privately and securely.
Service Discovery: Containers can reach each other by name (e.g., WordPress can reach MariaDB by using mariadb as the hostname).
Isolation: Services are isolated from other Docker containers not in the inception network.
By explicitly defining the inception network, you're ensuring all services can talk to each other while remaining secure and isolated from any other containers running outside of this application.




The args section in your Docker Compose file is important, but its significance depends on how you're building your Docker image. Here's a detailed explanation:

What are args in Docker Compose?
args are build-time variables used to pass values into the build process when Docker is constructing an image. They are defined in the Dockerfile and can be supplied during the docker build process.
They are different from environment variables (env or env_file), which are runtime variables that containers use while they are running. args only affect the image-building stage, not the actual running container.
Example in Your Case:
yaml
Copy code
args:
  DB_DATABASE : ${DB_DATABASE}
  MYSQL_USER : $MYSQL_USER
  MYSQL_PASSWORD : $MYSQL_PASSWORD
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD : $MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
In this section, the args are passing the database details (like the database name, user, and password) to the build process when Docker creates the MariaDB image.
These values come from environment variables (typically defined in the .env file), and Docker substitutes them during the build phase.
Are args important?
Yes, if you're building custom images. If your Dockerfile is designed to use these args during the image build process, then they are necessary for the successful build of the image.

For example:

If your Dockerfile for MariaDB in requirements/mariadb uses these arguments (e.g., setting default environment variables or configuring certain behaviors in the image), then the args are essential for building the image with the correct database setup.

In a typical Dockerfile, you might see something like this:

Dockerfile
Copy code
ARG DB_DATABASE
ARG MYSQL_USER
ARG MYSQL_PASSWORD
ARG MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD

# Use these ARG values to set up the MariaDB configuration at build-time.
If you're using a pre-built image (like the official mariadb image) and don't need to customize it at build time, the args section may not be necessary. Instead, you would only need to use environment variables (env_file or environment) to configure MariaDB at runtime.

If you’re using a pre-built MariaDB image
If you're simply using the official mariadb image and not customizing it with a custom Dockerfile in requirements/mariadb, the args section may be redundant. In that case, you can pass all configuration using the environment variables at runtime:

Using env_file: You already have this in your Compose file, where the environment variables are loaded from .env and passed to the container at runtime.
Should you keep args?
If you're building a custom MariaDB image from the requirements/mariadb directory (where you have a Dockerfile that uses these args), then you should keep them. They ensure the image is built with the correct settings.

If you're using a pre-built image (like image: mariadb from Docker Hub) and you're not building a custom image, you likely don't need the args section. You can rely solely on env_file or environment variables to pass configuration when the container starts.

To summarize:
args are important if you're building a custom Docker image from a Dockerfile and need to pass certain configuration options during the build process.
If you're using pre-built images, you probably don’t need args and can configure the container using environment variables (env_file).
Check if you have a Dockerfile in requirements/mariadb. If it uses ARG instructions, the args are necessary. If not, you might be able to remove them.





how do I know what a docker-compose.yml needs?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To understand what your docker-compose.yml file needs, you should focus on what your application requires to run properly within a Docker environment. This will depend on the architecture of your app, the services it needs, and how those services should interact. Here's a step-by-step guide to figuring out what your docker-compose.yml file needs:

1. Understand Your Application’s Components
The first step is to break down the components of your application. For example, in the case of a typical web application, you may need:

A web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache).
An application server (e.g., WordPress, Django, Node.js).
A database (e.g., MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
Other dependencies (e.g., Redis, a caching server, or message queues).
You need to determine which services your application requires. In your current example, the components are:

MariaDB: A database for storing data.
WordPress: The actual application (web-based content management system).
Nginx: A web server to handle traffic and serve the WordPress application.
2. Determine Container Requirements for Each Component
Once you know the services, determine what each container needs. Think about:

Docker images: Which Docker images should be used for each service? Should you use pre-built images (e.g., from Docker Hub) or build custom ones from a Dockerfile?

In your example, you use images like mariadb, nginx, and wordpress.
Volumes: Does the service need persistent storage? Some services, like databases, need volumes to store data so that it's not lost when the container restarts.

Example: MariaDB and WordPress need volumes to persist their data across container restarts.
Ports: What ports need to be exposed to access the services externally?

Example: Nginx may expose port 443 to serve your web application over HTTPS.
Environment Variables: Does the service need environment variables to be configured, like database credentials?

Example: MariaDB needs variables like MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, and DB_DATABASE to set up the database.
3. Services Section
For each component, you define a service. A service represents a container and its associated configuration.

Image: What Docker image will be used (e.g., mariadb, wordpress, or nginx)?
Build: If you need a custom image, you specify a build section that tells Docker Compose where to find the Dockerfile.
Environment Variables: What configuration does the container need at runtime? For instance, databases need credentials.
Volumes: Do you need to store data persistently or share files between the container and the host?
Ports: Which ports need to be mapped between the host and the container?
4. Networking Configuration
Think about how your containers should communicate with each other. You often need to create a custom network in Docker Compose to allow your services to interact securely.

Why? Containers on the same network can communicate using their service names as hostnames.
Example: Your nginx container might talk to wordpress, and WordPress might need to talk to the mariadb container for database access.
5. Volumes for Data Persistence
Some services, like databases and CMS platforms (e.g., WordPress), need to persist data. You should configure volumes to ensure data is not lost when containers are restarted or rebuilt.

Why? Without volumes, any data created inside a container will be lost when the container is stopped or destroyed.
Example: MariaDB needs a volume to persist its database files, and WordPress needs a volume to persist its content files.
6. Handling Dependencies Between Services
Some services depend on others. For example, WordPress needs the MariaDB service to be up before it can start.

Use depends_on: You can specify dependencies between services using the depends_on key in Docker Compose. This ensures services start in the correct order.
yaml
Copy code
depends_on:
  - mariadb    # Ensure MariaDB is started before WordPress
7. Use Environment Files for Configuration
To avoid hardcoding sensitive configuration values (like database passwords) directly in your docker-compose.yml, use an .env file.

Why? This keeps your Compose file clean and allows you to easily change configuration settings without editing the file itself.
Example: You can use .env to set variables like MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, and DB_DATABASE.
yaml
Copy code
env_file:
  - .env       # Load environment variables from an .env file
8. Restart Policies
You should define how Docker should handle container restarts. Use the restart policy to define whether containers should be automatically restarted if they crash.

yaml
Copy code
restart: unless-stopped    # Restart the container unless it is explicitly stopped
9. Special Features or Requirements
Lastly, consider if your application has any specific requirements, such as:

Ports: You may need to expose certain ports (e.g., 443 for HTTPS or 80 for HTTP).
Logging: You may want to configure logging or other monitoring tools.
Scaling: If you need multiple instances of a service, you can specify a number of replicas in Docker Compose.
Example: Building a Docker Compose File
Here’s how you’d build a docker-compose.yml file based on the requirements:

yaml
Copy code
version: "3.8"

services:
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb
    container_name: mariadb
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - .env              # Load environment variables from .env file
    volumes:
      - mariadb:/var/lib/mysql  # Persist MariaDB data
    networks:
      - app_network        # Connect to the custom network

  wordpress:
    image: wordpress
    container_name: wordpress
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - mariadb            # Start MariaDB before WordPress
    env_file:
      - .env               # Load environment variables from .env file
    volumes:
      - wordpress:/var/www/html  # Persist WordPress content
    networks:
      - app_network        # Connect to the custom network

  nginx:
    image: nginx
    container_name: nginx
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - wordpress          # Start Nginx after WordPress
    ports:
      - "443:443"          # Expose port 443 (HTTPS)
    networks:
      - app_network        # Connect to the custom network

networks:
  app_network:
    name: inception        # Custom network for the app

volumes:
  mariadb:
    driver: local          # Local storage for MariaDB data
  wordpress:
    driver: local          # Local storage for WordPress content
Summary of What to Include:
Services:

Define all services (databases, web servers, etc.).
Use official or custom Docker images.
Set dependencies between services.
Build Requirements:

If building custom images, specify the build context.
Pass args if needed during the image build process.
Configuration:

Use environment variables or files (env_file).
Set up volumes for persistent storage.
Expose necessary ports for services.
Networking:

Define networks to allow inter-service communication.
Restart Policies:

Use appropriate restart policies for container health management.
By focusing on your application’s needs, you can tailor your docker-compose.yml file to ensure each service is properly configured, communicates securely, and can be easily managed.

### --------------------------------------------

### Dockerfile  --------------------------------

# Dockerfile

The difference between a docker-compose.yml file and a Dockerfile lies in their purposes and roles within Docker-based development environments:

1. Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a set of instructions used to build a Docker image. It defines everything needed to assemble the image, such as the base image, dependencies, configurations, and file structures. The image created from the Dockerfile can then be run as a container.

Key Points:
Purpose: To create a custom Docker image.
Usage: Defines how to build a single container image.
Syntax: Uses instructions like FROM, RUN, COPY, CMD, and others to describe what goes into the image.
Basic Example of a Dockerfile:
Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use an official Python runtime as a base image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define the command to run the app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
What it does:
Pulls the Python 3.9 base image.
Copies local files into the container.
Installs Python dependencies.
Specifies the command to run the app.
2. docker-compose.yml
A docker-compose.yml file is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to manage multiple services, networks, and volumes in one place. While the Dockerfile defines how to build a single image, docker-compose.yml defines how to orchestrate multiple containers.

Key Points:
Purpose: To define and manage multi-container applications.
Usage: Specifies how to configure, connect, and manage multiple services, networks, and volumes.
Syntax: YAML-based configuration that specifies services, networks, volumes, environment variables, and more.
Basic Example of a docker-compose.yml:
yaml
Copy code
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
What it does:
Defines two services: web and db.
Builds a custom image for the web service (e.g., from the Dockerfile).
Uses the official postgres image for the db service.
Links the services together so they can communicate.
Key Differences
Feature	Dockerfile	docker-compose.yml
Purpose	Defines how to build a single Docker image.	Defines how to run and manage multi-container Docker applications.
Scope	Focuses on building a single image.	Focuses on managing the configuration of multiple containers.
File Format	Shell-like script, with commands like RUN, COPY, CMD.	YAML configuration format for services, networks, volumes, etc.
Use Case	Used when you need to build a custom image.	Used when you want to orchestrate multiple services (like web and database) working together.
Image Creation	Builds a Docker image from the instructions.	Uses prebuilt images or builds from a Dockerfile.
Service Management	Cannot manage multiple containers directly.	Defines how services interact, their networks, and volumes.
Dependencies	No concept of dependencies between containers.	Can define dependencies between services (e.g., depends_on).
Networks and Volumes	Cannot define networks or volumes.	Can define custom networks and volumes for services.
Example Usage	Building a Python app or Node.js server image.	Running a web app with Nginx, MySQL, and Redis in separate containers.
How They Work Together
In many cases, docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile are used together:

Dockerfile is used to build a custom image with your application and its dependencies.
docker-compose.yml is used to define and manage multiple services (containers) and how they interact (e.g., a web app, database, caching service, etc.).
Workflow Example:
Create a Dockerfile: Define how to build your application container.
Create a docker-compose.yml: Use this file to start your custom container (from the Dockerfile) along with other services like databases, caches, etc.
Run docker-compose up: Compose will start the multiple containers, build images if needed, and manage the whole application.
When to Use What:
Use Dockerfile when you need to create a custom Docker image for your application (e.g., a web app with dependencies).
Use docker-compose.yml when you need to manage multiple services, connect containers, define networks, and orchestrate how containers work together.
In essence, Dockerfile is for building images, and docker-compose.yml is for running and managing containers in a multi-service environment.


Let’s break down your Dockerfile for WordPress and address its correctness and functionality. Here's a more detailed explanation of each part:

1. Base Image Selection:
dockerfile
Copy code
# Use Debian as a base image (Debian 12)
FROM debian:bookworm
What it does:
This line sets the base image for your container to Debian 12 (Bookworm). Since your requirement was to use the penultimate stable version of Debian, this is correct for now (as the latest would be "Debian 13").
Why it matters:
Using Debian ensures you have a stable, general-purpose Linux distribution with access to extensive software packages. It also allows for optimizations specific to Debian’s package management system (apt).
2. Updating the Package Manager and Installing Dependencies:
dockerfile
Copy code
# Update & install your package manager
RUN apt-get -y update && \
	apt-get install php-fpm php-mysql -y && \
	apt-get install curl -y
What it does:

apt-get -y update updates the package manager's local cache of available packages.
apt-get install php-fpm php-mysql -y installs php-fpm (FastCGI Process Manager) and php-mysql (PHP extension for MySQL). These are essential for running WordPress: php-fpm handles PHP processes, and php-mysql allows PHP to communicate with MySQL/MariaDB databases.
apt-get install curl -y installs curl, a tool used to transfer data from or to a server. It’s useful for downloading WordPress during setup or handling other external requests.
Why it matters:

The php-fpm and php-mysql packages are critical for serving PHP files and connecting to the MariaDB database in your setup. Without these, the WordPress container cannot function properly.
3. Copying the Custom WordPress Setup Script:
dockerfile
Copy code
COPY ./tools/wp-script.sh /
What it does:

This copies the script wp-script.sh from the tools directory on your local machine into the container’s root directory (/).
The script likely contains custom steps to set up WordPress, such as downloading WordPress files, setting correct permissions, or initializing the environment.
Why it matters:

Scripts like this can automate the setup of WordPress, handling tasks that otherwise would have to be done manually. It provides a repeatable way to configure the container correctly.
Ensure that this script is executable by setting the right permissions with chmod +x.
4. Exposing Port 9000:
dockerfile
Copy code
# Make port 9000 available to the wor### --------------------------------------------ld outside this container
EXPOSE 9000
What it does:

This line tells Docker to expose port 9000 of the container, which is the port on which php-fpm will listen. This is the port that NGINX will use to communicate with WordPress (via PHP-FPM).
Why it matters:

Exposing this port is necessary for other services (like NGINX in this case) to connect to this container. Without exposing it, no other container or external service could interact with the PHP-FPM process running inside this container.
5. Defining the Command to Run:
dockerfile
Copy code
# Define the command to run the app
CMD ["/.wp-script.sh"]
What it does:

This defines the default command that runs when the container starts. In this case, it is set to run your wp-script.sh script, which presumably sets up and configures WordPress.
However, there is a mistake here: the path /./wp-script.sh is incorrect; it should be /wp-script.sh (since the script was copied to the root directory).
Why it matters:

The CMD directive is essential for ensuring that the container performs its intended function when it starts. If this script is not correctly defined, the container will fail to start or work improperly.
In your case, the correct path would be /wp-script.sh because the script was copied to the root directory (/).
Suggested Corrections:
Fix the path for the startup script:

The path in CMD should be /wp-script.sh, not /.wp-script.sh.
Ensure PHP-FPM is started correctly:

php-fpm should be started to handle PHP requests. You can add a line in the script to start php-fpm or directly start it in the CMD.
You could modify the CMD directive to start php-fpm and also execute the WordPress setup script.
Here’s a revised version of the Dockerfile:

dockerfile
Copy code
# Use Debian as a base image (Debian 12)
FROM debian:bookworm

# Update & install necessary packages
RUN apt-get -y update && \
    apt-get install -y php-fpm php-mysql curl && \
    apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the WordPress setup script
COPY ./tools/wp-script.sh /

# Make sure the script is executable
RUN chmod +x /wp-script.sh

# Expose port 9000 for PHP-FPM
EXPOSE 9000

# Start PHP-FPM and run the custom WordPress script
CMD ["/bin/bash", "/wp-script.sh"]
Explanation of Changes:
Added chmod +x: Ensures that the wp-script.sh file is executable inside the container.
Fixed the CMD path: Changed CMD to /wp-script.sh and used bash to execute it properly.
Included php-fpm handling: Ensure that php-fpm is running in your wp-script.sh file or separately configure php-fpm to run in the CMD section.
Make sure your wp-script.sh does everything necessary to prepare WordPress, including downloading the WordPress files if they are not in the image already, configuring wp-config.php, and starting php-fpm. Here's an example of what it might include:

### --------------------------------------------


---



# wordpress

### dockerfile ----------------------------------
- Use Debian as a base image (Debian 12)
- Update & intstall your package manager (RUN)
- Copy `wp-config.php` & `wp-script.sh` script from 'tools' directory into the container’s root directory (/). (COPY)
- Make sure the script is executable (NOT necessary for 'wp-config.php', since PHP just reads it) (RUN)
- Expose port 9000 (EXPOSE)
- Start PHP-FPM and run the custom WordPress script (CMD)




The issue where the mysqladmin command cannot be found suggests that mysql-client is still not installed or correctly configured in your WordPress Docker container.
The error you're encountering indicates that the mysql-client package is unavailable in the Debian 12 (Bookworm) repositories, which is causing the apt-get command to fail during the build process. Specifically, the package mysql-client is no longer available under that name in newer versions of Debian, including Bookworm.

Solution: Use the Correct MySQL Client Package
In recent versions of Debian, the MySQL client package has been replaced with mariadb-client. Since you are using MariaDB in your stack, the correct package to install would be mariadb-client instead of mysql-client.
### --------------------------------------------


is it okay that this is happening now in the dockerfile instead of the script.sh?
# Download WP-CLI directly into the /usr/local/bin directory
RUN curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar && \
    chmod +x wp-cli.phar && \
    mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, it's perfectly fine—and actually quite good practice—to move the WP-CLI installation steps to the Dockerfile instead of handling them in script.sh. Here’s why this adjustment is beneficial:

Efficiency: By including WP-CLI installation in the Dockerfile, Docker caches this step in the image. This way, WP-CLI doesn't have to be downloaded each time you start a new container, which speeds up container startup.

Cleaner Script: script.sh now focuses only on the WordPress setup and configuration tasks, making it simpler and easier to debug.

Reduced Network Dependency: Since the WP-CLI download and installation occur during the build phase, this step only needs internet access once. Future builds and deployments of this container won't rely on the WP-CLI download server, which improves reliability.

Revised Dockerfile and Script Overview
With the WP-CLI installation in the Dockerfile, here’s a streamlined flow:

Dockerfile: Installs the necessary dependencies and downloads WP-CLI. This creates a reliable base image with everything WordPress needs.
script.sh: Uses WP-CLI to configure and start WordPress, now assuming WP-CLI is already installed and available.
In summary, this approach is both robust and more efficient. Your current setup looks good—let it build and run, and watch for any further configuration logs to confirm everything's working end-to-end!



3. Fix the PHP-FPM executable issue
The error /wp-script.sh: line 45: /usr/sbin/php-fpm7.4: No such file or directory indicates that the php-fpm7.4 executable doesn't exist. This may happen because the version specified (php-fpm7.4) is not installed in your container.

Instead of using php-fpm7.4, simply use php-fpm (which will default to the latest installed version of PHP-FPM). Update your wp-script.sh to use this:

bash
Copy code
exec /usr/sbin/php-fpm -F
This will start PHP-FPM without specifying a version number, ensuring it uses the installed PHP-FPM version.



Important Considerations:

Make sure that your wp-script.sh does two critical things:
Install and Configure WordPress: Download WordPress, configure database credentials (through wp-config.php), and ensure that WordPress files are in the right place.
Start PHP-FPM: It should start the php-fpm process to handle incoming PHP requests. If php-fpm isn't started, the container will not be able to serve any requests.
Example of wp-script.sh:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Download and unpack WordPress if not already present
if [ ! -f /var/www/html/wp-config.php ]; then
  echo "Downloading WordPress..."
  curl -O https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
  tar -xzf latest.tar.gz -C /var/www/html --strip-components=1
  rm latest.tar.gz
  echo "WordPress downloaded and extracted."
fi

# Move the custom wp-config.php into place
mv /wp-config.php /var/www/html/wp-config.php

# Start PHP-FPM in the foreground
echo "Starting PHP-FPM..."
php-fpm7.4 -F
Explanation of the Script:
Download and Extract WordPress:

It checks if wp-config.php already exists in the /var/www/html directory (where WordPress files should reside). If it doesn't, the script downloads and extracts WordPress.
Move wp-config.php:

This moves your custom wp-config.php to the correct location inside the WordPress directory (/var/www/html).
Start PHP-FPM:

The php-fpm7.4 -F command starts the php-fpm service and keeps it running in the foreground (-F). This is essential for the container to keep running and handle PHP requests.


could i also do this?
CMD ["/wp-script.sh"]

instead of this 
CMD ["/bin/bash", "/wp-script.sh"]?

Yes, you can use the following:

dockerfile
Copy code
CMD ["/wp-script.sh"]
Key Differences and Considerations:
Direct Execution vs. Using Bash:

CMD ["/wp-script.sh"]: This attempts to run the wp-script.sh directly. For this to work, the script needs to have a proper "shebang" (#!/bin/bash or #!/bin/sh) at the top. The shebang tells the system which interpreter (like bash or sh) to use when running the script. If the shebang is missing, the system may not know how to execute the script.

Example of a proper shebang at the start of the script:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
CMD ["/bin/bash", "/wp-script.sh"]: This explicitly runs the script with bash. Even if the shebang is missing or if the script isn’t marked executable, this ensures the script is run by bash.

When to use each:

Use CMD ["/wp-script.sh"] if:
Your script has a proper shebang (#!/bin/bash or #!/bin/sh) at the top.
The script is marked executable (chmod +x /wp-script.sh).
Use CMD ["/bin/bash", "/wp-script.sh"] if:
You want to ensure the script runs with bash no matter what.
You don’t need the script to be executable (though it's still a good practice to make it executable).

1. Generating the Authentication Keys and Salts for wp-config.php
The values for AUTH_KEY, SECURE_AUTH_KEY, etc., are security keys and salts that WordPress uses for encrypting information stored in user cookies. You can generate new ones using the [WordPress Secret Key Generator](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/). Simply visit that URL, and it will provide a unique set of values. Copy and paste these into your wp-config.php file where you see the keys and salts defined.


### --------------------------------------------
### Test wordpress -----------------------------

To test if your WordPress setup is working in Docker, you need to ensure that the WordPress container is up and accessible. Since Nginx and MariaDB are not yet configured, you can follow these steps to test WordPress in isolation:

Verify the Container is Running
Run the command below to check if the container is running as expected:

bash
Copy code
docker ps
Look for a container with the name or image name matching wordpress. If it's not running, you may need to troubleshoot the Dockerfile.

Check Container Logs
Inspect the WordPress container logs to see if there are any errors. Run:

bash
Copy code
docker logs wordpress
This can help you identify issues if the container starts but fails internally.

Set up Temporary PHP Server for WordPress Testing
Since you don't yet have Nginx configured, use PHP’s built-in server in the WordPress container to check if WordPress loads. First, connect to the container:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it wordpress bash
Then navigate to the directory where WordPress is located (usually /var/www/html for Dockerized WordPress), and run the built-in PHP server:

bash
Copy code
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
might to install:
Command 'php' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo apt install php8.3-cli  # version 8.3.6-0ubuntu0.24.04.2, or
sudo apt install php-cli     # version 2:8.2+93ubuntu1
sudo apt install php8.2-cli  # version 8.2.12-1ubuntu2

This will start a web server on port 8000 inside the container.

Access WordPress Locally
In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:8000. You should see the WordPress setup page if everything is working correctly within the container.

Next Steps
Once this is working, you can set up Nginx and MariaDB, reconfigure the WordPress container to connect to them, and test the complete setup.

Start PHP Built-in Server: If your Docker container is already set to start PHP-FPM, you might need to ensure that you also expose a port for the built-in server. Since you're using a Dockerfile with PHP-FPM, you might want to run PHP's built-in server as follows:

Option A: Modify Your Dockerfile to Run PHP Built-in Server
You can change your CMD in the Dockerfile or run the built-in server directly in the terminal after accessing your container. Here’s an example of how you might modify the last line in your Dockerfile to run the PHP server:

dockerfile
Copy code
CMD ["php", "-S", "0.0.0.0:8000", "-t", "/var/www/html/wordpress"]
This will start the PHP built-in server and serve files from the specified directory.

Option B: Running it in the Terminal
If you want to start the PHP built-in server manually, you can do the following:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it your_wordpress_container_name bash
cd /var/www/html/wordpress
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000

# mariadb
To set up a MariaDB container with custom configuration, you would typically need:
- `Dockerfile` : This defines the MariaDB image build, installing any necessary tools and copying configuration files into the container.
- `Initialization Script (db-script.sh)` : This script initializes the database, sets up users, databases, and permissions, and ensures that MariaDB keeps running in the foreground.
- `Custom Configuration File (custom_config.cnf) `: This file customizes MariaDB’s server settings, like port, bind address, caching, logging, and character sets.

### dockerfile ---------------------------------
- Use Debian as a base image (FROM)
- Update & intstall your package manager (RUN)
- Copy custom MariaDB configuration script AND custom_config.cnf (COPY) 
- Expose port 3306 (EXPOSE)
- Run the MariaDB setup script and start the server in the foreground (CMD)
### --------------------------------------------
### script -------------------------------------
Such a script usually takes care of preparing the environment, initializing the database if necessary, setting up security configurations, creating a database, and ensuring MariaDB runs in the foreground.
Let's go through this MariaDB initialization script step by step:

This is the "shebang" line. It tells the system that the script should be executed using /bin/bash, a common Unix shell.
You alway need this line at the top of your script.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
- Create Necessary Directories and Set Permissions:
MariaDB requires specific directories for data and logs. The script should create these directories and adjust permissions to ensure that the MariaDB process has access to them.
- Check if the Database Directory Exists:
The script checks if the MariaDB data directory is already initialized. If not, it initializes the database.
      - Secure MariaDB Installation:
        This step usually involves securing the MariaDB installation, similar to the interactive mysql_secure_installation command.
        This script segment automates the security questions asked during the mysql_secure_installation. Options include:
            - Setting a root password
            - Removing anonymous users
            - Disallowing root login remotely
            - Removing the test database
            - Reloading privilege tables
        Note: Replace "password" with a secure password of your choice.
      - Create a New Database (if specified):
        If you want to create a new database, you can add a check and run the necessary SQL command.
      - Create a New User and Grant Privileges (if specified):
        If a user and password are provided, the script creates the user and grants the necessary privileges.
            - CREATE USER: Adds a new user with a specified password.
            - GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES: Gives the new user full access to the specified database.
            - FLUSH PRIVILEGES: Refreshes the privilege tables to apply changes.
- Keep MariaDB Running in the Foreground:
To ensure the database service stays active in the foreground (important for containerized environments like Docker).
            - `exec mysqld` replaces the current shell process with the MariaDB server, keeping it running in the foreground.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Create necessary directories and set permissions as root
mkdir -p /run/mysqld /var/log/mysql
chown -R mysql:mysql /run/mysqld /var/log/mysql

# Check if the database directory exists
if [ ! -d "/var/lib/mysql/${MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME}" ]; then
    echo "Initializing MariaDB database..."

    # Secure MariaDB installation
    mysql -u root <<EOF
    -- Set the root password
    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF

    # Create a new database if specified
    if [ -n "$MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME" ]; then
        echo "Creating database: $MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME"
        mysql -u root -p"${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}" -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS \`${MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME}\` CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
    fi

    # Create a new user and grant privileges if specified
    if [ -n "$MYSQL_USER" ] && [ -n "$MYSQL_PASSWORD" ]; then
        echo "Creating user: $MYSQL_USER with access to $MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME"
        mysql -u root -p"${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}" <<EOF
        CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS '${MYSQL_USER}'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '${MYSQL_PASSWORD}';
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON \`${MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME}\`.* TO '${MYSQL_USER}'@'%';
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF
    fi

    echo "Database initialization complete."
else
    echo "Database already exists. Skipping initialization."
fi

# Keep MariaDB running in the foreground
echo "Starting MariaDB in the foreground..."
exec mysqld
```

Environment Variables: 
$DB_NAME, $DB_USER, and $DB_PASSWORD should be set in the environment before running the script, or you can hard-code them (not recommended for security reasons).


### --------------------------------------------
### custom_config.cnf --------------------------

The custom_config.cnf file is a configuration file for the MariaDB server, specifically for setting server-side options that control database behavior, storage, networking, and performance. Let’s break down the main sections and settings:

# Structure of the Configuration File
1) Sections:
Configuration files are organized into sections. Each section starts with a name in square brackets, such as [server], [mysqld], [embedded], etc. The parameters defined under each section apply to that specific component of MariaDB.
2) Key-Value Pairs:
Each setting is defined as a key-value pair, where the key is the configuration option, and the value specifies its setting.

# 1) Sections: General Server Configuration Sections
The configuration file is divided into sections (like [mysqld], [mariadb], etc.) that specify settings for different components of the MariaDB server. Each section can contain specific settings related to that component.
- `[server]` : This section applies to the entire MariaDB server, both for standalone and embedded servers.
- `[mysqld]` : Settings in this section apply only to the mysqld standalone MariaDB server daemon.
- `[embedded]`, `[mariadb]`, `[mariadb-10.3]` : These sections define options specific to embedded servers, MariaDB-specific options, and MariaDB version-specific settings, respectively.

# 2) Key-Value Pairs: Basic Settings
# User and PID file settings
- `user` : Sets the user under which the MariaDB server runs.
- `pid-file` : Path for the PID file, which helps manage the MariaDB process.

# Socket and Port settings
- `socket` : Location of the MariaDB Unix socket file for local connections.
- `port` : Sets the port for TCP/IP connections (default MySQL/MariaDB port).

# Directories settings
- `basedir` : Base directory where MariaDB is installed.
- `datadir` : Directory for storing database files.
- `tmpdir` : Temporary files directory used by the server.
- `lc-messages-dir` : Directory for error messages and translations.

# Network settings
- `bind-address` : Specifies the network interface on which MariaDB listens for incoming connections. Setting this to 0.0.0.0 means it accepts connections from all interfaces.

# Fine Tuning
This section contains various parameters that can fine-tune the performance of the server.
Example parameters:
- `key_buffer_size        = 16M`
- `max_allowed_packet     = 16M`
- `thread_stack           = 192K`
- `thread_cache_size      = 8`
- `myisam_recover_options = BACKUP`
- `max_connections        = 100`
- `table_cache            = 64`
- `thread_concurrency     = 10`

# Query Cache Configuration
- `query_cache_size` : Size of the query cache, which stores results of queries to improve performance.

# Logging and Replication
- `log_error` : Path to the error log file, which is crucial for troubleshooting.
- `expire_logs_days` : Number of days to keep binary logs before they are automatically removed.

# Settings for general logging and slow query logging if desired:
- `general_log_file       = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log`
- `general_log            = 1`
- `slow_query_log_file    = /var/log/mysql/mariadb-slow.log`
- `long_query_time        = 10`
- `log_slow_rate_limit    = 1000`
- `log_slow_verbosity     = query_plan`
- `log-queries-not-using-indexes`

# Replication setup
- `server-id              = 1`
- `log_bin                = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log`
- `max_binlog_size        = 100M`
- `binlog_do_db           = include_database_name`
- `binlog_ignore_db       = exclude_database_name`

# Security Features
Security configurations related to connections and SSL.
Uncomment and configure if required.
- `chroot = /var/lib/mysql/`
- `ssl-ca = /etc/mysql/cacert.pem`
- `ssl-cert = /etc/mysql/server-cert.pem`
- `ssl-key = /etc/mysql/server-key.pem`
- `ssl-cipher = TLSv1.2  # Ensure the latest TLS protocol is used for secure connections.`

# Character Sets
Character set settings to support various languages and symbols.
- `character-set-server` : Defines the default character set for the server.
- `collation-server` : Defines the default collation for string comparison.

# Unix Socket Authentication Plugin
This is for Unix socket authentication, allowing the root user to authenticate without a password when running as the Unix root user.
See https://mariadb.com/kb/en/unix_socket-authentication-plugin/ for details.

### --------------------------------------------
### Test MariaDB -------------------------------
Navigate to the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` and run the following command:

RUN:
(Build your container):
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
-> The -d flag runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

(Check the Running Services): 
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

(View Logs):
```bash
docker-compose logs mariadb
```

(Accessing the MariaDB Instance):
Might need to install `sudo apt install mysql-client-core-8.0`
```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u "$MYSQL_USER" -p"$MYSQL_PASSWORD"
```
-> If everything works till here your database is running 
- 1. Verify Database and User Creation:
```sql
# SHOW DATABASES;
```
-> Make sure your database (your_database_name) is listed. 
-> Should look like:
```sql
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- 2. Check if your user is created with the right permissions:
```sql
# SELECT host, user FROM mysql.user;
```
-> This should list your USER.
-> Should look like:
```sql
mysql> SELECT host, user FROM mysql.user;
+-----------+-------------+
| Host      | User        |
+-----------+-------------+
| %         | bob         |
| %         | root        |
| 127.0.0.1 | healthcheck |
| ::1       | healthcheck |
| localhost | healthcheck |
| localhost | mariadb.sys |
| localhost | root        |
+-----------+-------------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- 3. To confirm the user's permissions:
```sql
# SHOW GRANTS FOR '<USER>'@'%';
```
If the USER does not have the correct permissions:
-> Should look like:
```sql
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'bob'@'%';
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for bob@%                                                                                   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `bob`@`%` IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '*61584B76F6ECE8FB9A328E7CF198094B2FAC55C7' |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
- 4. Correct Any Issues with User Permissions
```sql
# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `<your_database_name>`.* TO '<USER>'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<your_password>';
# FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
-> Should look like:
```sql
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `mariadb`.* TO 'bob'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'bob';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

- 5. Retry Connecting from the Host
Exit from the container and try connecting again from your host:
```bash
$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u "$MYSQL_USER" -p"$MYSQL_PASSWORD"
```
-> Should look like:
```sql
$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u "$MYSQL_USER" -p"$MYSQL_PASSWORD"

Enter password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

- `Check the Directory Path` : Make sure that the directory /home/<username>/data/mysql exists on your host machine. You can check this using the terminal:
```bash
ls /home/<username>/data/mysql

If it doesn’t exist, you'll need to create it.
```bash
mkdir -p /home/<username>/data/mysql

This command will create the directory along with any necessary parent directories.

- `Re-run Docker Compose` : After ensuring the directory exists and has the correct permissions, try running your Docker Compose command again:
```bash
docker volume rm mariadb
```
-> Be careful with this command as it will delete the volume and all data stored in it.

```bash
docker-compose up -d

Great! It looks like you were able to successfully connect to the MariaDB server as the root user. 
Now, let’s verify that the user and database were created as expected and troubleshoot the access issue with your application user.

Now that you’re inside the MariaDB shell, run the following commands to check if your intended database and user exist.
- Check Databases:
```sql
# SHOW DATABASES;
```
-> Look for the database name you specified in your MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME variable.

- Check Users:
Check if the user you created exists and their access privileges
```sql
# SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
```
-> Look for your specified MYSQL_USER. It should show up with a % host entry, allowing access from any host.

- Grant Privileges to USER:
If USER should have access to the database but isn't seeing it, make sure to grant the necessary privileges:
```sql
# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `<your_database_name>`.* TO '<USER_NAME>'@'%';
# FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

I removed the sections in your script related to creating a new database and user because you mentioned that the main issue was with getting MariaDB up and running in the container. When MariaDB is started with --skip-grant-tables and --skip-networking, it allows you to bypass some common authentication mechanisms and makes it easier to manipulate database users, but that also means certain commands (like creating new users and granting privileges) might not be executed as expected when MariaDB is still in that state.

Here’s why I removed those sections:

Database and User Creation:

The initial script was likely stopping before the part where the database and users were created because --skip-grant-tables disables grants and privileges management until MariaDB is fully started. This could cause issues with user creation or setting up the database if you run those commands while the server is in that state.
If you're already creating the database and user inside Docker via environment variables or setup during the container build phase (or it's pre-configured), the script might not need to do that step again.
Container Setup:

The script was running MariaDB with --skip-grant-tables, meaning MariaDB was essentially in a "maintenance mode" where privileges were disabled. It's safe to set the root password, but trying to create a new database or user when you're still in this state might cause issues, especially if it’s already been set up in the Dockerfile or environment.
Once MariaDB is fully initialized and ready, you don’t need to create new users or databases unless it’s part of your setup routine for specific applications that expect certain databases/users to exist.
Stability:

After MariaDB is started and you set the root password, you can later safely switch back to normal mode, but running these commands immediately after starting with --skip-grant-tables could lead to an incomplete or misconfigured setup if the instance isn't yet fully initialized.
Suggested Fix:
If you want to retain the creation of a database and user, the better place to do that would be after the MariaDB server has been fully initialized and running (i.e., after mysqld has started in the foreground without --skip-grant-tables), and not before. This ensures you're interacting with a fully operational database that can properly execute those commands.

If your Docker setup or MariaDB initialization already takes care of database creation and user setup, you can skip those commands.

Final Script (with database and user creation):
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Create necessary directories and set permissions as root
mkdir -p /run/mysqld /var/log/mysql
chown -R mysql:mysql /run/mysqld /var/log/mysql

# Start mysqld with networking enabled
echo "Starting mysqld..."
mysqld --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking &
pid="$!"

# Wait for mysqld to be ready
echo "Waiting for mysqld to be ready..."
while ! mysqladmin ping --silent; do
    sleep 1
done
echo "MariaDB is ready."

# Secure MariaDB installation
mysql -u root <<EOF
-- Set the root password
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF

# Create a new database if specified
if [ -n "$MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME" ]; then
    echo "Creating database: $MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME"
    mysql -u root -p"${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}" -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS \`${MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME}\` CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
fi

# Create a new user and grant privileges if specified
if [ -n "$MYSQL_USER" ] && [ -n "$MYSQL_PASSWORD" ]; then
    echo "Creating user: $MYSQL_USER with access to $MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME"
    mysql -u root -p"${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}" <<EOF
    CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS '${MYSQL_USER}'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '${MYSQL_PASSWORD}';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON \`${MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME}\`.* TO '${MYSQL_USER}'@'%';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF
fi

echo "Database initialization complete."

# Stop the temporary mysqld instance
echo "Stopping the temporary mysqld instance..."
kill "$pid"
wait "$pid"

# Keep MariaDB running in the foreground
echo "Starting MariaDB in the foreground..."
exec mysqld
Key Changes:
Moved the database and user creation after MariaDB has been secured with the root password.
You can create the database and user only after the MariaDB instance is fully initialized and running.
Summary:
Removing those parts temporarily helps ensure that MariaDB starts correctly.
Once the database is fully initialized and operational, you can safely create databases and users.
If your MariaDB container is pre-configured with the necessary databases and users, you can skip these parts entirely.

# NGINX

###  Docker ----------------------------
This Dockerfile sets up a Docker image with NGINX installed on a Debian Linux (Debian 12 "Bookworm") base image, along with a self-signed SSL certificate for TLS encryption. Let’s break it down line by line:

1. FROM debian:bookworm
Specifies the base image for the Docker container. Here, it uses the Debian 12 ("Bookworm") version as the OS. This means the container will have a minimal Debian Linux environment to start with.
2. RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install -y nginx openssl -y
apt-get update -y updates the package lists to ensure the latest versions are available.
apt-get upgrade -y upgrades any outdated packages on the base image.
apt-get install -y nginx openssl installs NGINX (the web server) and OpenSSL (for creating SSL/TLS certificates) in one command. The -y flag automatically confirms the installation, so it runs without manual intervention.
3. RUN openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout "/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key" -subj "/C=/ST=/L=/O=/CN=${DOMAIN_NAME}" -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
This command creates a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL for secure HTTPS connections.
-x509 specifies the certificate format (X.509 is the standard format for TLS certificates).
-nodes means no password protection on the private key, so NGINX can load it without user input.
-days 365 sets the certificate to be valid for 365 days.
-newkey rsa:2048 generates a new 2048-bit RSA key pair.
-keyout specifies where to save the private key.
-subj "/C=/ST=/L=/O=/CN=${DOMAIN_NAME}" generates a certificate with the subject fields, including the common name (CN) for the domain. The ${DOMAIN_NAME} variable is expected to be defined externally.
-out specifies where to save the public certificate.
4. COPY conf/default-nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/
Copies a custom NGINX configuration file (default-nginx.conf) from the Docker build context’s conf directory into the container at /etc/nginx/conf.d/. This configuration file customizes how NGINX will handle requests, routes, or server settings.
5. EXPOSE 443
Tells Docker to expose port 443 on the container for HTTPS traffic. However, this does not automatically publish the port to the host. You’ll need to publish this port explicitly when running the container (e.g., using -p 443:443).
6. CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
Sets the command to run when the container starts. nginx is started with the flag -g "daemon off;" to prevent it from running as a background process. This keeps the container running and allows Docker to monitor the main process.



The difference between -keyout /etc/nginx/key.pem and -keyout "/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key" lies in the file paths and naming conventions used to store the private key. Let's break down what each part means and how these paths affect where the key is stored.

1. File Path Differences
-keyout /etc/nginx/key.pem

This specifies that the private key will be stored in the /etc/nginx/ directory with the filename key.pem.
The /etc/nginx/ directory typically holds NGINX configuration files and custom assets specific to NGINX, such as certificates or custom server settings. While storing the private key here works, it may not follow typical conventions and could expose the key to other users if permissions aren’t carefully set.
The .pem file extension is often used to denote cryptographic files that store keys or certificates in "Privacy-Enhanced Mail" (PEM) format, which is widely used for SSL certificates.
-keyout "/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key"

This path places the private key in /etc/ssl/private/, which is a standard location in Linux for storing private keys, with the filename nginx-selfsigned.key.
The /etc/ssl/ directory is typically used to store SSL certificates and private keys in subdirectories:
/etc/ssl/private/ is intended for private keys.
/etc/ssl/certs/ is generally used for public certificates.
This directory typically has restricted access for security, making it a more secure choice for storing private keys.
2. Security and Convention
Using /etc/ssl/private/ is generally more secure and follows Linux conventions, as it restricts access by default. This can reduce the risk of unintended access to sensitive files. The /etc/nginx/ directory does not have the same restrictive permissions by default, so storing keys here could be less secure unless permissions are manually adjusted.

3. File Naming Conventions
The file name itself, key.pem vs. nginx-selfsigned.key, is more about clarity than functionality.

key.pem is a more generic name and may be less clear in its purpose if you manage multiple keys.
nginx-selfsigned.key specifies that it’s a self-signed certificate generated for NGINX, which can help avoid confusion if multiple keys are present.
Summary
/etc/nginx/key.pem: Stores the private key in the NGINX directory, but it’s less secure and unconventional for storing SSL keys.
/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key: Stores the key in a secure, standard location, making it more secure and in line with common Linux SSL configurations.
For production environments, it's recommended to use /etc/ssl/private/ for storing private keys due to security best practices.
### --------------------------------------------

### Config.conf --------------------------------

Your NGINX configuration file is mostly correct, but there are a few improvements and potential corrections you may want to consider, especially for security and compatibility. Let's go through each section with comments on adjustments.

1. listen Directive for SSL
nginx
Copy code
listen 443 ssl;
listen [::]:443 ssl;
These lines look good and will bind both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to port 443 for SSL.
2. server_name Directive
nginx
Copy code
server_name $DOMAIN_NAME www.$DOMAIN_NAME localhost;
This line sets the server name for your virtual host. Ensure that $DOMAIN_NAME is set correctly in the environment, or replace it with an actual domain name (e.g., example.com). Otherwise, NGINX might fail to parse the variable.
3. SSL Settings
nginx
Copy code
ssl on;
ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl on; is technically redundant and can be omitted. Including ssl in the listen directive (listen 443 ssl;) is sufficient to enable SSL.
Certificates: The paths are correct, assuming these files exist at the specified locations.
SSL Protocols: Specifying TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 is a good practice to support the most secure and compatible protocols. You may also want to add an ssl_ciphers directive to control which ciphers are allowed:
nginx
Copy code
ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
4. File Handling
nginx
Copy code
root /var/www/wordpress;
index index.html index.php;
try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
These settings look fine:
root sets the document root for the server.
index specifies default files when a directory is requested.
try_files $uri $uri/ =404; tries to load the file directly or look for a directory with the requested name; if neither exists, it returns a 404 error.
5. PHP Location Block
nginx
Copy code
location ~ \.php$ {
    fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;
    fastcgi_index index.php;
    include fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
}
fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000; assumes that there’s a FastCGI server (e.g., PHP-FPM) available at wordpress:9000.
Make sure the hostname wordpress resolves within your Docker network or adjust this to 127.0.0.1:9000 if running PHP-FPM locally in the container.
SCRIPT_FILENAME and PATH_INFO parameters look good.
include fastcgi_params;: Ensure that fastcgi_params exists in your configuration files (usually in /etc/nginx/), as it includes essential FastCGI parameters.
Final Suggested Config File
Here’s the configuration with the improvements and comments integrated:

nginx
Copy code
server {
    listen                  443 ssl;
    listen                  [::]:443 ssl;
    server_name             $DOMAIN_NAME www.$DOMAIN_NAME localhost;

    # SSL
    ssl_certificate         /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key     /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
    ssl_protocols           TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers             HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # File Handling
    root                    /var/www/wordpress;
    index                   index.html index.php;
    try_files               $uri $uri/ =404;

    # PHP Processing
    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass        wordpress:9000;  # Ensure the 'wordpress' hostname resolves correctly
        fastcgi_index       index.php;
        include             fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param       SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param       PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
    }
}
This should be a solid configuration for your NGINX setup. Just ensure that:

$DOMAIN_NAME is properly defined.
The paths to fastcgi_params and SSL certificates are accurate.
The fastcgi_pass setting is correct based on your network setup.

# Extra INFO

###  .conf and .cnf ----------------------------
difference between `.conf` and `.cnf`

Both `.conf` and `.cnf` are commonly used for configuration files, but they are often associated with different types of applications or services.
Key Differences: 
`.conf` is more general and used by many different types of software, associated with operating system services and various servers.
`.cnf` is more specialized, often used for MySQL and database-related configurations, associated with database configurations.

### --------------------------------------------
###  Docker version ----------------------------

The version field was used in older versions of Docker Compose (pre-1.27.0) to specify the format of the configuration file and indicate which features were available in the Docker Compose specification. 
However, from Docker Compose v1.27.0 onwards, the requirement for a version field has been deprecated.

Older Docker Compose files (versioned):
Here, '3.9' specifies the schema version of the Docker Compose file.
```yaml
version: "3.9"

services: 
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb
```

Newer Docker Compose (no version field): With newer versions of Docker Compose (v1.27.0 and beyond), the version field is no longer required. You can simply define the services without specifying a version:
```yaml
services: 
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb
```
